      <li>Fluids are substances that can flow and take the shape of their container, including both liquids and gases.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="density" data-hint="Mass per unit volume">density</span> of a fluid is its mass per unit volume, typically measured in kg/m¬≥.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Specific gravity" data-hint="Density relative to water">Specific gravity</span> compares the density of a substance to the density of water.</li>
      
      <li>Objects submerged in fluids experience <span data-quiz="buoyancy" data-hint="Upward force on submerged objects">buoyancy</span>, an upward force that opposes gravity.</li>
            
      <li>The pressure at any depth in a static fluid is called <span data-quiz="hydrostatic pressure" data-hint="P = œÅgh">hydrostatic pressure</span> and increases with depth.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Pascal's law" data-hint="Pressure transmitted equally">Pascal's law</span> states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.</li>
      
      <li>The resistance of a fluid to flow is called <span data-quiz="viscosity" data-hint="Fluid's resistance to flow">viscosity</span>, with honey being more viscous than water.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Poiseuille flow" data-hint="Laminar flow through tubes">Poiseuille flow</span> describes the smooth, laminar flow of viscous fluids through cylindrical tubes.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="continuity equation" data-hint="A¬∑v = constant">continuity equation</span> states that the product of cross-sectional area and velocity remains constant for incompressible flow.</li>
      
      <li>At high velocities, smooth flow can break down into chaotic <span data-quiz="turbulence" data-hint="Chaotic fluid motion">turbulence</span> with swirling eddies.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Surface tension" data-hint="Cohesive force at liquid surface">Surface tension</span> is the cohesive force that acts on the surface of liquids, allowing some insects to walk on water.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Bernoulli's equation" data-hint="Energy conservation in fluids">Bernoulli's equation</span> describes how pressure decreases when the speed of a fluid increases.</li>
    </ul>
