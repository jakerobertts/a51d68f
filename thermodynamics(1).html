    <ul>
      <li>Thermodynamics is the study of energy transfer and the relationship between heat, work, and temperature in physical systems.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="thermodynamic laws" data-hint="Fundamental principles of energy">thermodynamic laws</span> are fundamental principles that govern energy transfer and entropy in all physical processes.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="PV diagrams" data-hint="Pressure vs volume graphs">PV diagrams</span> graphically represent the relationship between pressure and volume during thermodynamic processes.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="entropy" data-hint="Measure of disorder">Entropy</span> is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, which always increases in isolated systems.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="enthalpy" data-hint="Heat content at constant pressure">Enthalpy</span> represents the total heat content of a system at constant pressure, useful for analyzing chemical reactions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="calorimetry" data-hint="Measuring heat changes">Calorimetry</span> is the experimental technique used to measure heat changes during physical or chemical processes.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="heat transfer" data-hint="Energy flow due to temperature difference">Heat transfer</span> occurs through conduction, convection, and radiation when there are temperature differences.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="phase changes" data-hint="Solid, liquid, gas transitions">Phase changes</span> involve transitions between solid, liquid, and gas states with characteristic energy requirements.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="first law" data-hint="Energy conservation">first law</span> of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="second law" data-hint="Entropy always increases">second law</span> of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.</li>
      
      <li>In <span data-quiz="isothermal" data-hint="Constant temperature process">isothermal</span> processes, temperature remains constant while pressure and volume change.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="adiabatic" data-hint="No heat exchange process">Adiabatic</span> processes occur without heat exchange between the system and surroundings.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="isobaric" data-hint="Constant pressure process">Isobaric</span> processes maintain constant pressure while temperature and volume change.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="isochoric" data-hint="Constant volume process">Isochoric</span> processes keep volume constant while pressure and temperature change.</li>
    </ul>
