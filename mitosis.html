    <h1>Mitosis & Meiosis Overview</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Mitosis</strong> is the process by which a single cell divides
        to produce two genetically identical
        <span data-quiz="daughter cells" data-hint="Cells produced by mitosis"
          >daughter cells</span
        >, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell
        (diploid, 2n).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mitosis is essential for
        <span data-quiz="growth" data-hint="Increase in size">growth</span>,
        <span data-quiz="repair" data-hint="Fixing damaged tissues">repair</span
        >, and
        <span
          data-quiz="asexual reproduction"
          data-hint="Reproduction without gametes"
          >asexual reproduction</span
        >
        in multicellular organisms.
      </li>
      <li>
        The stages of mitosis are:
        <span data-quiz="prophase" data-hint="Chromosomes condense"
          >prophase</span
        >,
        <span data-quiz="metaphase" data-hint="Chromosomes align at the center"
          >metaphase</span
        >,
        <span data-quiz="anaphase" data-hint="Sister chromatids separate"
          >anaphase</span
        >, and
        <span data-quiz="telophase" data-hint="Nuclear envelope reforms"
          >telophase</span
        >, followed by
        <span data-quiz="cytokinesis" data-hint="Division of the cytoplasm"
          >cytokinesis</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meiosis</strong> is a two-part cell division process that
        produces four genetically unique
        <span data-quiz="gametes" data-hint="Sperm or egg cells">gametes</span>
        (sperm or egg cells), each with half the number of chromosomes of the
        original cell (haploid, n).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meiosis introduces genetic diversity through
        <span
          data-quiz="crossing over"
          data-hint="Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes"
          >crossing over</span
        >
        (prophase I) and
        <span
          data-quiz="independent assortment"
          data-hint="Random distribution of chromosomes"
          >independent assortment</span
        >
        (metaphase I).
      </li>
      <li>
        The two divisions of meiosis are called
        <span data-quiz="meiosis I" data-hint="Homologous chromosomes separate"
          >meiosis I</span
        >
        (homologous chromosomes separate) and
        <span data-quiz="meiosis II" data-hint="Sister chromatids separate"
          >meiosis II</span
        >
        (sister chromatids separate).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Key differences:</strong> Mitosis produces two identical diploid
        cells for growth and repair; meiosis produces four unique haploid
        gametes for sexual reproduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Homologous chromosomes</strong> are pairs of chromosomes (one
        from each parent) that have the same genes but may have different
        alleles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sister chromatids</strong> are identical copies of a chromosome,
        connected by a centromere, separated during mitosis and meiosis II.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Synapsis</strong> and <strong>tetrad formation</strong> occur in
        prophase I of meiosis, allowing for crossing over.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nondisjunction</strong> is the failure of chromosomes to
        separate properly during meiosis, leading to aneuploidy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>In meiosis <span data-quiz="I">I</span>,
      reduction division occurs, where homologous chromosomes are separated into
      different daughter cells, halving the chromosome number. Crossing over and
      independent assortment are exclusive to
      <span data-quiz="meiosis">meiosis</span> and contribute to genetic
      diversity in the resulting gametes. Crossing over increases genetic
      variation by producing recombinant
      <span data-quiz="chromosomes">chromosomes</span>, while independent
      assortment contributes to genetic diversity by producing different
      combinations of <span data-quiz="alleles">alleles</span> in gametes.
