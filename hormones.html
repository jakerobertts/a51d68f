    <h1>Hormones & the Endocrine System</h1>
    <li>
      Hormones are produced by the endocrine system and travel through the
      bloodstream to target organs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hormones can be classified into three main types:

        data-hint="These are made of amino acids and are water-soluble."
        >peptide hormones</span
      >,
      <span
        data-quiz="steroid"
        data-hint="These are derived from cholesterol and are lipid-soluble."
        >steroid hormones</span
      >, and
      <span
        data-quiz="tyrosine-derived"
        data-hint="These are synthesized from single amino acids like tyrosine."
        >Tyrosine-derived hormones</span
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hormones regulate various physiological processes, including metabolism,
      growth, and reproduction.
    </li>

      Hormone deficiency or excess can lead to disorders such as
      <span

        data-quiz="thyroid disease"
        data-hint="Disorders related to the thyroid gland."
        >thyroid disease</span
      >, and
      <span
        data-quiz="adrenal insufficiency"
        data-hint="A condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones."
