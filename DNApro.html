    <h1>DNA in Prokaryotes VS Eukaryotes</h1>
    <li>
      The Jacob-Monad operon model describes the regulation of gene expression
      in prokaryotes, where genes are organized into
      <span
        data-quiz="operons"
        data-hint="A group of genes that are regulated together"
        >operons</span
      >
      that can be turned on or off as a unit.
    </li>
    <li>
      The operon concept includes a promoter, an operator, and structural genes.
      The promoter is where
      <span data-quiz="RNA polymerase">RNA polymerase</span> binds to initiate
      transcription, the <span data-quiz="operator">operator</span> is a
      regulatory region that can block RNA polymerase binding, and the
      structural genes are the actual genes being transcribed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Genes are repressed in bacteria by
      <span
        data-quiz="repressors"
        data-hint="Proteins that inhibit gene transcription"
        >repressors</span
      >, which bind to the operator and prevent RNA polymerase from transcribing
      the genes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Positive control in prokaryotes involves
      <span
        data-quiz="activators"
        data-hint="Proteins that enhance gene transcription"
        >activators</span
      >, which bind to the promoter or enhancer regions to facilitate RNA
      polymerase binding and transcription initiation.
    </li>
    <li>
      In eukaryotes, DNA is regulated through a complex interplay of
      <span
        data-quiz="transcription factors"
        data-hint="Proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate transcription"
        >transcription factors</span
      >, enhancers, and silencers, allowing for precise control of gene
      expression in response to developmental and environmental cues.
    </li>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong> Upstream is the
      <span data-quiz="promoter" data-hint="Region where RNA polymerase binds"
        >promoter</span
      >
      region, while the
      <span
        data-quiz="downstream"
        data-hint="Regulatory region that blocks transcription"
        >downstream</span
      >
      region is the region that is transcribed into mRNa.   Negative control
      involves the binding of
      <span
        data-quiz="repressors"
        data-hint="Proteins that inhibit gene transcription"
        >repressors</span
      >
      to the operator. Positive control involves the binding of
      <span
        data-quiz="activators"
        data-hint="Proteins that enhance gene transcription"
        >activators</span
      >
      to the promoter or enhancer regions. Repressible operons are usually
      turned on by the presence of a specific
      <span
        data-quiz="substrate"
        data-hint="Molecule that activates gene expression"
        >substrate</span
      >, while inducible operons are turned off in the presence of a specific
      <span
        data-quiz="product"
        data-hint="Molecule that inhibits gene expression"
        >product</span
      >. The shine-dalgarno sequence is a ribosomal binding site in bacterial
      mRNA, facilitating the initiation of
      <span data-quiz="translation" data-hint="Process of protein synthesis"
        >translation</span
      >. Although transcription and translation are separated in time and space
      in eukaryotes, they are coupled in
      <span
        data-quiz="prokaryotes"
        data-hint="Single-celled organisms without a nucleus"
        >prokaryotes</span
      >, allowing for rapid response to environmental changes.
