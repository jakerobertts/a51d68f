    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
      Hi everyone! My name is Jake and I am the creator of Percentyle. I am a
      biomedical engineering student at Arizona State University. I graduated
      SUNY Geneseo with a degree in biology in 2023, but I wanted to pursue more
      options in biology and the medical field. As I was pursuing these options,
      I started studying for the MCAT in May of 2025. I created the website
      primarily to help students study for the MCAT. I found it quite difficult
      to study for the MCAT on my own due to expensive resources, so I wanted to
      create a platform that would make studying more accessible and affordable
      for everyone using tools and prior knowledge I obtained with my bachelor's
      in biology. This site offers the basic combination of Skills 1 and 2
      required for the MCAT. Skill 1 is primarily content knowledge, and Skill 2
      is problem-solving based on that knowledge. My site provides the necessary
      resources and tools to help students succeed in their MCAT preparation.
      Please feel free to contact me through this email below if you have any
      questions. Good luck studying!
    </p>
