      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Type <span data-quiz="I">I</span> collagen
      is the most abundant type found in skin, tendons, and bones, providing
      tensile strength. Type <span data-quiz="II">II</span> collagen is
      primarily found in cartilage, providing support and elasticity. Type
      <span data-quiz="III">III</span> collagen is found in reticular fibers,
      supporting soft tissues like blood vessels and organs. The extracellular
      matrix plays a crucial role in cell signaling, tissue repair, and
      development. The <span data-quiz="basal lamina">basal lamina</span> is a
      specialized layer of the extracellular matrix that separates epithelial
      cells from underlying connective tissue, while the
      <span data-quiz="reticular lamina">reticular lamina</span> (type III
      collagen) provides support and anchoring fibrils like type VII collagen.
      <span data-quiz="cadherens">Cadherens</span> are cell adhesion molecules
      that mediate cell-cell interactions, while integrins are transmembrane
      receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Focal
      adhesions are specialized structures where integrins bind to the
      extracellular matrix, linking it to the
      <span data-quiz="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</span>.
