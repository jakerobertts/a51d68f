    <h1>Amino Acids</h1>
    <h2>1°, 2°, 3°, and 4° structure of proteins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1° structure linkage is the
        <span data-quiz="peptide" data-hint="Linkage between amino acids"
          >peptide</span
        >
        bond between amino acids
      </li>
      <li>
        2° structure is the local folding of the polypeptide chain into
        <span data-quiz="alpha" data-hint="Common secondary structure"
          >alpha</span
        >
        helices and
        <span data-quiz="beta" data-hint="Common secondary structure"
          >beta</span
        >
        sheets, stabilized by
        <span data-quiz="hydrogen" data-hint="Common stabilizing interactions"
          >hydrogen</span
        >
        bonds.
      </li>
      <li>
        3° structure is the overall 3D shape of a protein, determined by
        interactions between R groups, including hydrophobic interactions,
        hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and
        <span
          data-quiz="disulfide"
          data-hint="Covalent bond between cysteine residues"
          >disulfide</span
        >
        bridges.
      </li>
      <li>
        4° structure is the assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits into a
        functional protein complex, stabilized by the same interactions as 3°
        structure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Amino Acid Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="nonpolar"
          data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains"
          >Nonpolar</span
        >
        amino acids have hydrophobic side chains that do not interact favorably
        with water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="polar"
          data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophilic side chains"
          >Polar</span
        >
        amino acids have side chains that can form hydrogen bonds with water,
        making them hydrophilic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="charged"
          data-hint="Amino acids with charged side chains"
          >Charged</span
        >
        amino acids have side chains that can gain or lose protons, resulting in
        positive or negative charges at physiological pH.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Protein Structure and Function</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Protein folding is driven by the
        <span
          data-quiz="hydrophobic"
          data-hint="Tendency of nonpolar side chains to avoid water"
          >hydrophobic</span
        >
        effect, where nonpolar side chains cluster away from water, and polar
        side chains interact with the aqueous environment
      </li>
      <li>
        Cysteine can form
        <span
          data-quiz="disulfide"
          data-hint="Covalent bond between cysteine residues"
          >disulfide</span
        >
        bonds, which are covalent linkages that
        <span data-quiz="stabilize">stabilize</span>
        protein structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="proline"
          data-hint="Amino acid that introduces kinks in the polypeptide chain"
          >Proline</span
        >
        introduces kinks in the polypeptide chain, affecting overall folding
      </li>
      <li>
        Conformational stability of proteins is influenced by factors such as
        <span data-quiz="pH">pH</span>
        and temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="denaturation">Denaturation</span> is the loss of
        protein structure and function due to factors like heat, pH changes, or
        chemical agents
      </li>
      <li>
        Hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in protein
        <span data-quiz="folding">folding</span>
        and stability, as nonpolar side chains tend to avoid contact with water,
        driving the folding process.
