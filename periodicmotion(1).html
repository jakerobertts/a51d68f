    <h1>Periodic Motion</h1>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="amplitude">amplitude</span> is the maximum
      displacement from the equilibrium position.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="frequency">frequency</span> is the number of cycles
      per second.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="phase">phase</span> is the position of a point in
      time on a waveform cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="wavelength">wavelength</span> is the distance between
      successive crests or troughs of a wave.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="wave speed">wave speed</span> is the distance
      traveled by a wave per unit time, calculated as the product of frequency
      and wavelength.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="transverse">transverse</span> waves are waves in which
      the particle displacement is perpendicular to the direction of wave
      propagation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="longitudinal">Longitudinal</span> waves are waves in
      which the particle displacement is parallel to the direction of wave
      propagation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="interference">Interference</span> is the phenomenon that
      occurs when two or more waves overlap and combine to form a new wave
      pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      Young's <span data-quiz="double-slit">double-slit</span> experiment
      demonstrates the wave nature of light through the observation of
      interference patterns. The main takeaway is that light behaves as a
      <span data-quiz="wave">wave</span>, exhibiting properties such as
      interference and diffraction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="diffraction">Diffraction</span> is the bending of waves
      around obstacles and the spreading of waves through openings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="single-slit">Single-slit</span> diffraction is a type of
      diffraction that occurs when waves pass through a narrow slit, resulting
      in a pattern of alternating light and dark bands on a screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="polarization">Polarization</span> is the orientation of
      the oscillations of a wave in a particular direction. It can occur in
      transverse waves, such as light waves.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="linear">Linear</span> polarization is when the
      oscillations of a wave are confined to a single plane.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="circular">Circular</span> polarization is when the
      oscillations of a wave rotate in a circular motion as the wave propagates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="electromagnetic">Electromagnetic</span> waves are waves
      that consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which propagate
      through space.
    </li>
    <li>
      X-ray diffraction is a technique used to study the structure of materials
      at the atomic level by observing the patterns produced when X-rays are
      scattered by a <span data-quiz="crystal">crystal</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="oscillating">Oscillating</span> fields are the electric
      and magnetic fields that vary sinusoidally in time and space in
      electromagnetic waves.
    </li>
    <li>
      The electromagnetic <span data-quiz="spectrum">spectrum</span> is the
      range of all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves to
      gamma rays.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="photon">Photon</span> energy is the energy carried by a
      single photon, which is directly proportional to the frequency of the
      electromagnetic wave.
