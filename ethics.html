    <h1>Ethics in Genetic Engineering</h1>
    <li>
      Ethics in genetic engineering involves the moral implications of
      manipulating genetic material. Key considerations include:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="consent"
            data-hint="Permission from individuals involved"
            >Consent</span
          >
          is crucial, especially in human genetic modifications, ensuring
          individuals are fully informed about the risks and benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="equity"
            data-hint="Fairness in access to genetic technologies"
            >Equity</span
          >
          addresses the potential for genetic engineering to exacerbate social
          inequalities, ensuring that access to genetic technologies is fair and
          just.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="safety"
            data-hint="Ensuring genetic modifications do not cause harm"
            >Safety</span
          >
          involves rigorous testing and regulation to prevent unintended
          consequences of genetic modifications, such as off-target effects or
          ecological impacts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="long-term effects"
            data-hint="Impact of genetic modifications over time"
            >Long-term effects</span
          >
          must be considered, as genetic modifications can have unforeseen
          consequences that may not be immediately apparent, requiring ongoing
          monitoring and assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="biodiversity"
            data-hint="Impact of genetic engineering on ecosystems"
            >Biodiversity</span
          >
          concerns arise from the potential for genetically modified organisms
          to disrupt ecosystems, leading to loss of genetic diversity and
          ecological balance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
