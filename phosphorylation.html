    <h1>Phosphorylation & Energy Transfer</h1>

    <h2>Types of Phosphorylation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="Substrate-level phosphorylation"
          data-hint="Direct phosphate transfer"
          >Substrate-level phosphorylation</span
        >
        involves direct transfer of a phosphate group from a high-energy
        compound to an
        <span data-quiz="ADP">ADP</span> molecule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Oxidative phosphorylation"
          >Oxidative phosphorylation</span
        >
        produces ATP using energy from the electron transport chain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="Photophosphorylation"
          data-hint="ATP synthesis using light energy"
          >Photophosphorylation</span
        >
        generates ATP using light energy in
        <span data-quiz="photosynthesis" data-hint="Light-dependent reactions"
          >photosynthesis</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Energy Transfer Molecules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="ATP" data-hint="Primary energy currency">ATP</span> is
        the primary energy currency of cells, storing energy in
        <span data-quiz="phosphate bonds" data-hint="High-energy bonds"
          >phosphate bonds</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="Creatine phosphate"
          data-hint="Energy storage in muscle"
          >Creatine phosphate</span
        >
        is a molecule that serves as an energy reserve in muscle cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="GTP" data-hint="Guanosine triphosphate">GTP</span> is a
        nucleotide used in protein synthesis and
        <span data-quiz="signal transduction" data-hint="G-protein signaling"
          >signal transduction</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>The
      <span data-quiz="creatine">creatine</span> phosphate system is a rapid
      source of ATP for short bursts of high-intensity activity, such as
      sprinting or weightlifting. It works by transferring a phosphate group
      from creatine phosphate to <span data-quiz="ADP">ADP</span>, regenerating
      ATP quickly. This system is particularly important in muscle cells during
      the initial stages of exercise.While <span data-quiz="GTP">GTP</span> is
      primarily involved in protein synthesis and signal transduction,
      <span data-quiz="ATP">ATP</span> is more involved in energy transfer
      within the cell.
