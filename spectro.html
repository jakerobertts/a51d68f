    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation, used to identify and analyze molecular structure.</li>
            <li>The <span data-quiz="fingerprint region" data-hint="Unique IR pattern below 1500 cm⁻¹">fingerprint region</span> is the area below 1500 cm⁻¹ in IR spectra that provides a unique pattern for each compound.</li>

      <li><span data-quiz="infrared" data-hint="Molecular vibrations">Infrared</span> radiation causes molecular vibrations, providing information about functional groups and bond types in molecules.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Aromatic fingerprint region is below <span data-quiz="1600">1600</span> cm⁻¹, unique to each compound.</li>
        <li>OH stretching vibration appears above <span data-quiz="3200">3200</span> cm⁻¹.</li>
        <li>Carbonyl (C=O) stretching appears around <span data-quiz="1700">1700</span> cm⁻¹.</li>
        <li>Alkene C=C stretching appears around <span data-quiz="1650">1650</span> cm⁻¹.</li>
        <li>Nitrile (C≡N) stretching appears around <span data-quiz="2200">2200</span> cm⁻¹.</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="IR spectroscopy" data-hint="Identifies functional groups">IR spectroscopy</span> uses infrared light to identify functional groups based on their characteristic vibrational frequencies.</li>
      
      
      <li><span data-quiz="visible absorption" data-hint="Light absorption in visible range">Visible absorption</span> occurs when molecules absorb light in the visible spectrum, often due to conjugated systems or colored compounds.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="UV absorption" data-hint="π→π* and n→π* transitions">UV absorption</span> involves electronic transitions, particularly π→π* and n→π* transitions in molecules with double bonds or lone pairs.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="conjugation" data-hint="Extended system of alternating bonds">Conjugation</span> refers to extended systems of alternating single and double bonds that lower energy gaps and shift UV absorption to longer wavelengths.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="NMR spectroscopy" data-hint="Nuclear magnetic resonance">NMR spectroscopy</span> uses nuclear magnetic resonance to determine molecular structure by analyzing the magnetic environment of nuclei.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Proton NMR provides information about the number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule.</li>
        <li>C-NMR provides information about the number of carbon atoms in a molecule.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="chemical shift" data-hint="Position of NMR peak">Chemical shift</span> is the position of an NMR peak relative to a reference standard, indicating the magnetic environment of the nucleus.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><span data-quiz="downfield">Downfield</span> shifts (higher ppm) indicate deshielding, often due to electronegative atoms.</li>
        <li><span data-quiz="upfield">Upfield</span> shifts (lower ppm) indicate shielding, often due to electron-donating groups.</li>
<li>A <span data-quiz="singlet">singlet</span> appears as a single peak in NMR, indicating no neighboring protons are present.</li>
<li>A <span data-quiz="doublet">doublet</span> appears as two peaks in NMR, indicating one neighboring proton is present.</li>
<li>A <span data-quiz="triplet">triplet</span> appears as three peaks in NMR, indicating <span data-quiz="two">two</span> neighboring protons are present.</li>
<li>A <span data-quiz="quartet">quartet</span> appears as four peaks in NMR, indicating <span data-quiz="three">three</span> neighboring protons are present.</li>
<li> C-NMR peaks are typically singlets due to the low natural abundance of 13C, resulting in minimal coupling with neighboring carbons.</li>
<li><span data-quiz="Alkenes">Alkenes</span> are the functional groups that appear between 105-140/150 ppm in C-NMR.</li>
<li><span data-quiz="Aromatic rings">Aromatic rings</span> are the functional groups that appear between 110-135 ppm in C-NMR.</li>
<li><span data-quiz="Alkynes">Alkynes</span> are the functional groups that appear between 60-100 ppm in C-NMR.</li>
<li><span data-quiz="Carbonyl">Carbonyl</span> carbons are the functional groups that appear between 160-220 ppm in C-NMR.</li>
      </ul>

      <li><span data-quiz="spin-spin splitting" data-hint="Peak splitting due to neighboring nuclei">Spin-spin splitting</span> causes NMR peaks to split into multiple lines due to magnetic interactions with neighboring nuclei.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="integration" data-hint="Peak area proportional to number of nuclei">Integration</span> in NMR measures the area under peaks, which is proportional to the number of nuclei in that environment.</li>
    </ul>
