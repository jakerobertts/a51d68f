    <h1>Separation Techniques</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Chromatography" data-hint="Technique for separating mixtures">Chromatography</span> separates compounds based on their affinity for a stationary phase versus a mobile phase.
        <span data-quiz="Column chromatography" data-hint="Technique using a column for separation">Column chromatography</span> uses a column filled with stationary phase material to separate compounds as they pass through.
        <span data-quiz="Thin-layer chromatography" data-hint="Technique using a plate for separation">Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)</span> uses a thin layer of stationary phase on a plate to separate compounds based on their movement up the plate with a solvent.
        <span data-quiz="HPLC" data-hint="High-pressure technique for separation">HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography)</span> uses high pressure to push the mobile phase through a column, allowing for faster and more efficient separation.

      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Distillation" data-hint="Separation based on boiling points">Distillation</span> separates liquids based on differences in boiling points, using heat to vaporize the more volatile component. <span data-quiz="Simple distillation" data-hint="Technique for large boiling point differences">Simple distillation</span> is used for mixtures with large differences in boiling points, while <span data-quiz="Fractional distillation" data-hint="Technique for close boiling point mixtures">fractional distillation</span> is used for mixtures with closer boiling points, using a fractionating column to improve separation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Filtration" data-hint="Separation based on particle size">Filtration</span> separates solids from liquids or gases by passing the mixture through a filter that allows only certain sizes to pass through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Centrifugation" data-hint="Separation based on density">Centrifugation</span> uses centrifugal force to separate components of different densities, with denser components moving to the bottom of a tube.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Electrophoresis" data-hint="Separation based on charge">Electrophoresis</span> separates charged particles in a gel or solution by applying an electric field, causing them to migrate towards the electrode of opposite charge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Crystallization" data-hint="Separation based on solubility">Crystallization</span> separates solids from a solution by forming solid crystals, which can then be collected by filtration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Extraction" data-hint="Separation based on solubility">Extraction</span> separates compounds based on their solubility in different solvents, allowing for the selective removal of desired components from a mixture.
        </li>
      
      </ul>
