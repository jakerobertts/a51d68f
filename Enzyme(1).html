    <h1>Enzyme function</h1>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by
        lowering the
        <span
          data-quiz="activation"
          data-hint="Energy required for a reaction to occur"
          >activation</span
        >
        energy required for the reaction to occur.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enzymes are highly specific, meaning they only catalyze specific
        reactions or act on specific substrates.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span data-quiz="active site" data-hint="Region where substrate binds"
          >active site</span
        >
        of an enzyme is the region where the substrate binds, and it is
        typically a small pocket or groove on the enzyme's surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enzyme activity can be affected by factors such as temperature, pH, and
        substrate concentration.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Enzyme Kinetics</h1>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enzyme kinetics is the study of the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
        and how they change in response to various factors.
      </li>
      <li>
        The mechanism of catalysis involves the formation of an
        <span data-quiz="enzyme-substrate complex" data-hint="Intermediate formed when an enzyme binds to its substrate"
          >enzyme-substrate complex</span
        >, which is a transient complex formed when the enzyme binds to its
        substrate.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Michaelis-Menten equation describes the relationship between the
        rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and the concentration of
        <span
          data-quiz="substrate"
          data-hint="The molecule upon which an enzyme acts"
          >substrate</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span data-quiz="Vmax" data-hint="Maximum rate of reaction">Vmax</span>
        is the maximum rate of reaction when the enzyme is saturated with
        substrate.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span data-quiz="Km" data-hint="Substrate concentration at half Vmax"
          >Km</span
        >
        is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of
        Vmax.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span
          data-quiz="turnover number"
          data-hint="Number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme per second"
          >turnover number</span
        >
        is the number of substrate molecules converted to product by one enzyme
        molecule per second.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span
          data-quiz="kcat"
          data-hint="Turnover number per enzyme concentration"
          >kcat</span
        >
        is the turnover number divided by the enzyme concentration, giving the
        rate of reaction per unit enzyme concentration.
      </li>
    
        <h1>Enzyme Cooperativity</h1>
        <li>
        The
        <span
          data-quiz="cooperativity"
          data-hint="How enzyme activity changes with substrate concentration"
          >cooperativity</span
        >
        of an enzyme refers to the way its activity changes in response to
        substrate binding.
      </li>
        <li>
            Enzymes can exhibit
            <span data-quiz="positive" data-hint="Increased activity with substrate binding"
            >positive </span
            >cooperativity, where the binding of one substrate molecule increases the enzyme's
            affinity for additional substrate molecules.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternatively, they can exhibit
            <span data-quiz="negative" data-hint="Decreased activity with substrate binding"
            >negative </span
            >cooperativity, where the binding of one substrate molecule decreases the enzyme's
            affinity for additional substrate molecules.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cooperativity can be visualized using a
            <span data-quiz="sigmoidal" data-hint="S-shaped curve">sigmoidal</span>
            curve, which indicates that the enzyme's activity increases more
            rapidly at certain substrate concentrations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cooperativity is measured by the <span data-quiz="Hill coefficient" data-hint="Quantifies degree of cooperativity">Hill coefficient</span>, which
            quantifies the degree of cooperativity in enzyme activity.
        </li>
      <h1>Enzyme Inhibition</h1>
     
      <li>
        Enzyme inhibitors can be classified as competitive, non-competitive, or
        uncompetitive based on their mechanism of action.
   
    <li>
      Competitive inhibitors bind to the <span data-quiz="active site" data-hint="Region where substrate binds">active site</span> of the enzyme, preventing
      substrate binding.
    </li>
    <li>
      Non-competitive inhibitors
      reduce the enzyme's activity without affecting substrate <span data-quiz="binding" data-hint="Interaction between enzyme and substrate">binding</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the <span data-quiz="enzyme-substrate " data-hint="The intermediate formed when an enzyme binds to its substrate">enzyme-substrate </span> complex, preventing
      the conversion of substrate to <span data-quiz="product" data-hint="The molecule produced by an enzyme-catalyzed reaction">product</span>.
    </li>
