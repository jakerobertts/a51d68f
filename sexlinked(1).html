    <h1>Sex-Linked Characteristics</h1>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="x">X</span>-inactivation is a process where one of the
      two X chromosomes in female mammals is randomly inactivated, leading to
      dosage compensation between males and females.
    </li>
    <li>
      Males are more likely to express
      <span data-quiz="recessive">recessive</span> traits linked to the X
      chromosome because they have only one X chromosome, while females have two
      and can be carriers without expressing the trait.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="sex">Sex</span> is determined by X and Y chromosomes,
      with <span data-quiz="males">males</span> having one X and one Y
      chromosome, and <span data-quiz="females">females</span> having two X
      chromosomes.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are very few genes on the Y chromosome, which is why
      <span data-quiz="y">Y</span>-linked traits are much rarer than
      <span data-quiz="x">X</span>-linked traits.
    </li>
