    <h1>Stoichiometry</h1>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions based on the balanced chemical equation and mole relationships.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="molecular formula" data-hint="Actual number of atoms in molecule">molecular formula</span> shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in one molecule of a compound.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="empirical formula" data-hint="Simplest whole number ratio">empirical formula</span> represents the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="percent composition" data-hint="Mass percentage of each element">Percent composition</span> gives the mass percentage of each element in a compound based on its molecular formula.</li>
      
      <li>A <span data-quiz="mole" data-hint="Avogadro's number of particles">mole</span> is a unit representing 6.022 × 10²³ particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units) of a substance.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="density" data-hint="Mass per unit volume">Density</span> is the mass per unit volume of a substance, often used in stoichiometric calculations involving gases and solutions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="oxidation numbers" data-hint="Electron bookkeeping">Oxidation numbers</span> are assigned to atoms to keep track of electron transfer in chemical reactions and help balance redox equations.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="balancing equations" data-hint="Equal atoms on both sides">Balancing equations</span> ensures that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides of a chemical equation.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="limiting reagent" data-hint="Reactant that runs out first">limiting reagent</span> is the reactant that is completely consumed first and determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="theoretical yield" data-hint="Maximum possible product">Theoretical yield</span> is the maximum amount of product that can be produced from given amounts of reactants, calculated from the balanced equation.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="percent yield" data-hint="Actual yield divided by theoretical yield">Percent yield</span> compares the actual yield obtained in an experiment to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Dive deeper: </strong>The limiting reactant is determined by dividing the number of <span data-quiz="moles">moles</span> of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation. The theoretical yield is determined by the limiting reagent and can be calculated using the mole <span data-quiz="ratios">ratios</span> from the balanced equation. The percent yield is calculated by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100.</p>
