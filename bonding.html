    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chemical bonding describes how atoms are held together in molecules and compounds through various types of attractive forces.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="covalent bonding" data-hint="Sharing electrons between atoms">Covalent bonding</span> involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms to achieve stable electron configurations.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Lewis structures" data-hint="Electron dot diagrams">Lewis structures</span> are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms and lone pairs of electrons in molecules.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="resonance" data-hint="Multiple valid Lewis structures">Resonance</span> occurs when a molecule can be represented by multiple valid Lewis structures that differ only in electron placement.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="hybridization" data-hint="Mixing atomic orbitals">Hybridization</span> is the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals that can form stronger bonds.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="sigma bonds" data-hint="Head-on orbital overlap">Sigma bonds</span> form from the direct, head-on overlap of orbitals and allow free rotation around the bond axis.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="pi bonds" data-hint="Side-by-side orbital overlap">Pi bonds</span> form from the side-by-side overlap of p orbitals and restrict rotation around the bond axis.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="molecular geometry" data-hint="3D arrangement of atoms">Molecular geometry</span> describes the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule based on electron pair positions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="VSEPR" data-hint="Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion">VSEPR</span> theory predicts molecular geometry based on the repulsion between electron pairs around a central atom.</li>
      <li><span data-quiz="bent" data-hint="Non-linear molecular shape">Bent</span> geometry occurs when there are two bonded atoms and one or more lone pairs on the central atom, resulting in a non-linear shape.</li>
      <li>Trigonal planar geometry occurs when there are <span data-quiz="three">three</span> bonded atoms and no lone pairs on the central atom, resulting in a flat triangular shape.</li>
      <li>Tetrahedral geometry occurs when there are <span data-quiz="four">four</span> bonded atoms and no lone pairs on the central atom, resulting in a three-dimensional shape with bond angles of approximately 109.5°.</li>
      <li>Trigonal bipyramidal geometry occurs when there are <span data-quiz="five">five</span> bonded atoms and no lone pairs on the central atom, resulting in a three-dimensional shape with bond angles of approximately 120° and 90°.</li>
      <li>Octahedral geometry occurs when there are <span data-quiz="six">six</span> bonded atoms and no lone pairs on the central atom, resulting in a three-dimensional shape with bond angles of approximately 90°.</li>

      <li><span data-quiz="intermolecular forces" data-hint="Forces between separate molecules">Intermolecular forces</span> are attractive forces that exist between separate molecules and affect physical properties.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="hydrogen bonding" data-hint="Strongest intermolecular force">Hydrogen bonding</span> is a strong intermolecular force that occurs when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative atoms like N, O, or F.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="dipole-dipole" data-hint="Attraction between polar molecules">Dipole-dipole</span> forces are intermolecular attractions between the positive and negative ends of polar molecules.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="London dispersion" data-hint="Weakest intermolecular force">London dispersion</span> forces are weak intermolecular forces caused by temporary dipoles in atoms and molecules.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="van der Waals" data-hint="Collective term for intermolecular forces">Van der Waals</span> forces is a collective term for intermolecular forces including dipole-dipole and London dispersion forces.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Methane (CH₄) has carbon surrounded by 8 electrons, which would fulfill the <span data-quiz="octet">octet</span> rule. In contrast, PCl₅ has an expanded octet. BF₃ has an incomplete octet. Ozone (O₃) has <span data-quiz="resonance">resonance</span> because the double bond can be placed between different oxygen atoms.</p>
