    <h1>Acids and Bases</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Acids and bases are fundamental chemical concepts that describe proton
        transfer reactions and solution chemistry in aqueous systems.
      </li>

      <li>
        The
        <span
          data-quiz="Brønsted-Lowry"
          data-hint="Proton donor/acceptor definition"
          >Brønsted-Lowry</span
        >
        definition describes acids as proton donors and bases as proton
        acceptors in chemical reactions.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="pH" data-hint="-log[H⁺]">pH</span> is the negative
        logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, providing a scale from 0-14
        to measure acidity and basicity.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Ka" data-hint="Acid dissociation constant">Ka</span> is
        the acid dissociation constant that quantifies the strength of an acid
        by measuring its degree of ionization.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Kb" data-hint="Base dissociation constant">Kb</span> is
        the base dissociation constant that quantifies the strength of a base by
        measuring its degree of ionization.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="pKa" data-hint="Negative log of Ka">pKa</span> is the
        negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, with lower pKa
        values indicating stronger acids.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="pKb" data-hint="Negative log of Kb">pKb</span> is the
        negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant, with lower pKb
        values indicating stronger bases.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="buffers" data-hint="Resist pH changes">Buffers</span>
        are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or
        base are added, consisting of weak acid-conjugate base pairs.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="titration"
          data-hint="Gradual addition to determine concentration"
          >Titration</span
        >
        is an analytical technique where a solution of known concentration is
        gradually added to determine the concentration of another solution.
      </li>

      <li>
        The
        <span data-quiz="equivalence point" data-hint="Moles acid = moles base"
          >equivalence point</span
        >
        in a titration is reached when the moles of acid equal the moles of base
        added.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="indicators" data-hint="Color change at specific pH"
          >Indicators</span
        >
        are compounds that change color at specific pH ranges, used to detect
        the endpoint of titrations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="neutralization" data-hint="Acid + base → salt + water"
          >Neutralization</span
        >
        reactions occur when acids and bases react to form salt and water, with
        the pH moving toward 7.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="strong acid" data-hint="Complete ionization in water"
          >Strong acid</span
        >
        completely ionizes in aqueous solution, releasing all available protons
        and having very low pKa values.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span data-quiz="weak acid" data-hint="Partial ionization in water"
          >Weak acid</span
        >
        only partially ionizes in aqueous solution, establishing an equilibrium
        between ionized and unionized forms.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="conjugate pairs"
          data-hint="Acid-base pairs differing by H⁺"
          >Conjugate pairs</span
        >
        are acid-base pairs that differ by a single proton, related through
        proton transfer reactions.
      </li>
    </ul>
