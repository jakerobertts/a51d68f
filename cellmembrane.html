    <h2>Membrane Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The cell membrane acts as a barrier to separate the internal
        environment from the external environment, maintaining homeostasis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Osmosis and diffusion are key processes for transporting and involve a <span data-quiz="downhill" data-hint="Movement from high to low concentration">downhill</span> concentration gradient.
    </li>
    <li> <span data-quiz="hypertonic" data-hint="Higher solute concentration inside the cell">hypertonic</span>, <span data-quiz="hypotonic" data-hint="Lower solute concentration inside the cell">hypotonic</span>, and <span data-quiz="isotonic" data-hint="Equal solute concentration">isotonic</span> solutions affect cell volume and pressure.</li>
        <li>
            Membrane proteins facilitate
            transport
            of molecules across the membrane, including
            <span data-quiz="active transport" data-hint="Requires energy"
            >active transport</span
            >
            and
            <span data-quiz="passive transport" data-hint="No energy required"
            >passive transport</span
            >.
        </li>
        <li>
            The membrane is selectively permeable, allowing certain substances to
            pass while restricting others.
        </li>
        <p><strong>Dive deeper: </strong><span data-quiz="primary">Primary</span> active transport directly uses ATP, while secondary active transport relies on the <span data-quiz="electrochemical">electrochemical</span> gradient created by primary active transport. <span data-quiz="facilitated diffusion">Facilitated diffusion</span> employs channels or carrier proteins, but still moves molecules down their gradient. Endocytosis and exocytosis have bulk transport mechanisms that also play crucial roles in moving large quantities of materials into and out of the cell. <span data-quiz="leaflet">Leaflet</span>-specific lipids are enriched in certain membrane domains, influencing membrane curvature and protein localization. <span data-quiz="lipid rafts">Lipid rafts</span> are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich microdomains important for signaling and membrane organization. <span data-quiz="flippases">Flippases</span> are enzymes that move phospholipids between bilayer leaflets.</p>
