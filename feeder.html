    <h1>Feeder Pathways</h1>
    <li>
      Feeder pathways are metabolic routes that provide substrates for central
      metabolic pathways like glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.They include
      pathways such as
      <span data-quiz="glycogenolysis" data-hint="Glycogen breakdown"
        >glycogenolysis</span
      >, and
      <span data-quiz="pentose phosphate" data-hint="Nucleotide synthesis"
        >the pentose phosphate</span
      >
      pathway.
    </li>
    <h2>Gluconeogenesis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate
        precursors, primarily occurring in the liver and kidneys.
      </li>
      <li>
        It involves reversing glycolysis, with some unique steps to bypass
        irreversible reactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first step is catalyzed by
        <span
          data-quiz="pyruvate carboxylase"
          data-hint="Converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate"
          >pyruvate carboxylase</span
        >, converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oxaloacetate is then converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by
        <span
          data-quiz="PEP carboxykinase"
          data-hint="Converts oxaloacetate to PEP"
          >PEP carboxykinase</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        The rate limiting step is catalyzed by
        <span
          data-quiz="fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"
          data-hint="Converts F-1,6-BP to F-6-P"
          >fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Alanine and glutamine are amino acids that
      contribute to <span data-quiz="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</span> by
      serving as precursors for pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. During
      periods of fasting or intense exercise, these amino acids can be released
      from muscle tissue and transported to the liver, where they are converted
      into glucose to help maintain blood sugar levels. Gluconeogenesis occurs
      in the <span data-quiz="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</span> of the cell. In
      addition to nucleotide synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway generates
      NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which are essential for
      <span data-quiz="fatty acid">fatty acid</span> synthesis and nucleotide
      synthesis.
