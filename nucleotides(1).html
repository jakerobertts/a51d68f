    <h1>Nucleotides & Nucleosides</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA. and
          consist of a <span data-quiz="nitrogenous">nitrogenous</span> base, a sugar (ribose or deoxyribosE., and
          one or more phosphate groups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nucleosides are similar to nucleotides but lack the <span data-quiz="phosphate">phosphate</span> group.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleic acids is formed by
            <span data-quiz="phosphodiester">phosphodiester</span>
            linkages between the 3' hydroxyl group of one sugar and the 5'
            phosphate group of the next sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nitrogenous bases can be classified as <span data-quiz="purines">purines</span> (adenine and guaninE)or
          <span data-quiz="pyrimidines"></span>pyrimidines</span> (cytosine, uracil, and thyminE..
        </li>
        <li>
            <span data-quiz="purines">Purines</span> have a two-ring structure, while <span data-quiz="pyrimidines">pyrimidines</span> have a single-ring structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sequence of nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids encodes genetic
          information, with specific base pairing rules (A-T and G-C in DNA; A-U and G-C in RNA..
        </li>
        <li>
            <span data-quiz="GC">GC</span> bonds are the strongest base pairs due to three hydrogen bonds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nucleotides include DNA, RNA, <span data-quiz="ATP">ATP</span> (involves energy transfer), and <span data-quiz="cAMP">cAMP</span> (involved in signaling), each serving different roles in cellular processes.
        </li>
        <li>
            DNA functions to store and transmit genetic information, while RNA plays roles in protein synthesis and regulation.
        </li>
