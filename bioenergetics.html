    <h2>Laws of Thermodynamics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The
        <span data-quiz="first law" data-hint="Energy conservation"
          >first law</span
        >
        states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from
        one form to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span data-quiz="second law" data-hint="Entropy always increases"
          >second law</span
        >
        states that
        <span data-quiz="entropy" data-hint="Measure of disorder">entropy</span>
        of the universe always increases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Free Energy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Gibbs free energy" data-hint="G = H - TS"
          >Gibbs free energy</span
        >
        determines whether a reaction is
        <span data-quiz="spontaneous" data-hint="ΔG < 0">spontaneous</span> or
        <span data-quiz="non-spontaneous" data-hint="ΔG > 0"
          >non-spontaneous</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Exergonic" data-hint="Energy-releasing reactions"
          >Exergonic</span
        >
        reactions release energy (ΔG < 0), while
        <span data-quiz="endergonic" data-hint="Energy-requiring reactions"
          >endergonic</span
        >
        reactions require energy input (ΔG > 0).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="ATP" data-hint="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</span>
        hydrolysis provides energy for endergonic reactions through
        <span
          data-quiz="coupled reactions"
          data-hint="Linking exergonic and endergonic"
          >coupled reactions</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is
        disturbed, it will shift to counteract the disturbance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="concentration changes">Concentration changes</span> can
        affect the position of equilibrium, favoring the side with fewer moles
        of gas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Catabolism refers to the set of metabolic pathways that break down
        molecules into smaller units and release energy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anabolic pathways build complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring
        energy input.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>In catabolism, reactions would primarily be
      <span data-quiz="exergonic" data-hint="Energy-releasing reactions"
        >exergonic</span
      >, releasing energy as they break down complex molecules. Anabolic
      reactions would be
      <span data-quiz="endergonic" data-hint="Energy-requiring reactions"
        >endergonic</span
      >, requiring energy input to build complex molecules. Hydrolysis reactions
      are also typically
      <span data-quiz="exergonic" data-hint="Energy-releasing reactions"
        >exergonic</span
      >, as they release energy by breaking down ATP. Synthesis reactions, on
      the other hand, are generally
      <span data-quiz="endergonic" data-hint="Energy-requiring reactions"
        >endergonic</span
      >, as they require energy input to form complex molecules from simpler
      ones. Irreversible reactions are those that proceed in one direction and
      do not reach equilibrium, while reversible reactions can proceed in both
      directions and reach equilibrium. <br />
