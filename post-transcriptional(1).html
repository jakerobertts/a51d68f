    <h1>Post-transcriptional Modifications</h1>
    <li>
      Post-transcriptional modifications are crucial for the maturation of
      eukaryotic mRNA. These modifications include:
    </li>
      <ul>
        <li><span data-quiz="5">5</span>'capping, where the <span data-quiz="5' end">5' end</span> is modified with a 7-methylguanylate cap</li>
        <li><span data-quiz="polyadenylation">Polyadenylation</span>, which adds a poly(A) tail to the 3' end</li>
        <li><span data-quiz="splicing">Splicing</span>, where <span data-quiz="introns">introns</span> are removed and <span data-quiz="exons">exons</span> are joined together</li>
        <li>
          <span data-quiz="alternative splicing">Alternative splicing</span>, which allows for the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene.
        </li>
        <li> Introns are thought to contribute to evolution by allowing for alternative splicing and the creation of new protein variants.</li>
        <li>
            <span data-quiz="ribozymes">Ribozymes</span> are RNA molecules that can catalyze their own splicing, playing a role in the removal of introns.
            <span data-quiz="spliceosomes">Spliceosomes</span> are large complexes made of RNA and protein that facilitate the splicing process by recognizing splice sites and catalyzing the removal of introns.
            <li>snRNPs (small nuclear ribonuclearproteins) are components of spliceosomes that recognize specific sequences at the <span data-quiz="intron-exon">intron-exon</span> boundaries, guiding the splicing process.
                <li>snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs) are RNA molecules that are part of the spliceosome and play a crucial role in the splicing process by <span data-quiz="catalyzing">catalyzing</span> the splicing reaction.</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
