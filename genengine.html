    <h1>Genetic Engineering</h1>
    <li>
      Gene cloning involves isolating a specific gene and inserting it into a
      <span
        data-quiz="vector"
        data-hint="A DNA molecule used to carry foreign genetic material into a host cell"
        >vector</span
      >, such as a plasmid, to produce multiple copies of the gene.

    <li>
      <span data-quiz="restriction enzymes" data-hint="Enzymes"
        >Restriction enzymes</span
      >
      are used to cut DNA at specific sequences, allowing for the insertion of
      foreign DNA into plasmids or other vectors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies specific
      <span data-quiz="DNA">DNA</span> sequences, enabling the production of
      large quantities of <span data-quiz="DNA">DNA</span> for analysis or
      cloning.
    </li>

    <li>
      <span data-quiz="DNA libraries">DNA libraries</span> are collections of
      cloned DNA fragments that represent the entire genome of an organism, used
      for sequencing and analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="cDNA">cDNA</span> is generated from mRNA using reverse
      transcriptase, allowing for the study of gene expression and the
      production of recombinant proteins.
    </li>
    <li>
      CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful tool for gene editing that allows for precise
      modifications to the genome by targeting specific DNA sequences.

      techniques, such as Southern blotting, are used to detect specific DNA
      sequences within a complex mixture, enabling the identification of genes
      or mutations.
    </li>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>First, restriction enzymes are used to cut
      DNA at specific sequences, allowing for the insertion of foreign DNA into
      <span data-quiz="vector">vectors</span>. DNA
      <span data-quiz="ligase">ligase</span> joins sticky ends at the backbones
      of DNA. Next, the recombinant DNA is introduced into host cells through
      transformation or transfection, enabling the expression of the inserted
      gene. Successful clones are selected via
      <span data-quiz="antibiotic">antibiotic</span> resistance.
