    <h1>Metabolic Pathway Regulation</h1>
    <li>
      Metabolic pathways are regulated by various mechanisms to maintain
      <span data-quiz="homeostasis">homeostasis</span> and respond to cellular
      needs. Homeostasis that is maintained for a prolonged period is called a
      <span data-quiz="steady state">steady state</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation are key
      metabolic pathways that are tightly regulated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enzymes in these pathways can be regulated by allosteric effectors,
      covalent modifications, and feedback inhibition.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hormones such as <span data-quiz="insulin">insulin</span> and
      <span data-quiz="glucagon">glucagon</span> play crucial roles in
      regulating glucose metabolism and energy balance in the body.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="insulin">Insulin</span> promotes glucose uptake and
      storage, while <span data-quiz="glucagon">glucagon</span> stimulates
      gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to increase blood glucose levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      They are both produced by the
      <span data-quiz="pancreas">pancreas</span> and have opposing effects on
      glucose metabolism.
