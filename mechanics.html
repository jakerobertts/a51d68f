    <h1>Mechanics</h1>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanics studies the motion of objects and the forces that cause motion, including both <span data-quiz="translational motion" data-hint="Motion in a straight line">translational motion</span> and rotational motion.</li>
      
      <li>A <span data-quiz="force" data-hint="Push or pull on an object">force</span> is any push or pull that can change an object's motion, measured in Newtons.</li>
      
      <li>When forces are balanced, an object remains at <span data-quiz="rest" data-hint="State of no acceleration">rest</span>, meaning it has zero net acceleration.</li>
      
      <li>When a force acts on an object through a distance, <span data-quiz="work" data-hint="Force times distance">work</span> is done, transferring energy to or from the object.</li>
      
      <li>The capacity to do work is called <span data-quiz="energy" data-hint="Capacity to do work">energy</span>, which exists in various forms including kinetic and potential.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Newton's third law" data-hint="Forces equal and opposite">Newton's third law</span> states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="friction" data-hint="Force opposing motion">Friction</span> is a contact force that opposes the relative motion between surfaces in contact.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="center of mass" data-hint="Balance point of object">center of mass</span> is the point where all the mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated.</li>
      
      <li>Forces can be analyzed using <span data-quiz="vector" data-hint="Mathematical treatment of direction">vector</span> analysis, which accounts for both magnitude and direction.</li>
      
      <li>Rotational motion involves <span data-quiz="torques" data-hint="Rotational force">torques</span>, which are forces applied at a distance from the axis of rotation.</li>
      
      <li>Simple machines provide <span data-quiz="mechanical advantage" data-hint="Force multiplication">mechanical advantage</span> by allowing a smaller input force to produce a larger output force.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="conservative forces" data-hint="Path-independent work">Conservative forces</span> do work that depends only on the starting and ending positions, not the path taken.</li>
      
      <li>Moving objects possess <span data-quiz="kinetic energy" data-hint="Energy of motion">kinetic energy</span>, which depends on their mass and velocity.</li>
      
      <li>Objects can store <span data-quiz="potential energy" data-hint="Stored energy">potential energy</span> due to their position in a force field, such as gravitational or elastic potential energy.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="conservation of energy" data-hint="Energy cannot be created or destroyed">conservation of energy</span> principle states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.</li>
      
      <li>The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred is called <span data-quiz="power" data-hint="Rate of energy transfer">power</span>, measured in watts.</li>
    </ul>
