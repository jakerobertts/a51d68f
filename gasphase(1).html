      <li><span data-quiz="kinetic molecular theory" data-hint="Model describing gas particle behavior">Kinetic molecular theory</span> explains gas behavior through assumptions about particle motion, size, and interactions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="absolute temperature" data-hint="Temperature measured from absolute zero">Absolute temperature</span> is measured from absolute zero, the theoretical point where all molecular motion ceases.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="Kelvin scale" data-hint="Absolute temperature scale">Kelvin scale</span> is the absolute temperature scale used in gas law calculations, with 0 K = -273.15°C.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="pressure" data-hint="Force per unit area">Pressure</span> is the force exerted by gas molecules per unit area on the walls of their container.</li>
      
      <li>A <span data-quiz="mercury barometer" data-hint="Device measuring atmospheric pressure">mercury barometer</span> measures atmospheric pressure using the height of mercury supported by air pressure.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="molar volume" data-hint="Volume occupied by one mole of gas">Molar volume</span> is the volume occupied by one mole of any gas under specified conditions of temperature and pressure.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="STP" data-hint="22.4 L/mol">STP</span> (Standard Temperature and Pressure) defines standard conditions where one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="ideal gas law" data-hint="PV = nRT">ideal gas law</span> relates pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas in the equation PV = nRT.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Boyle's law" data-hint="P₁V₁ = P₂V₂">Boyle's law</span> states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional at constant temperature and amount.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Charles's law" data-hint="V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂">Charles's law</span> states that volume and temperature are directly proportional at constant pressure and amount.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Avogadro's law" data-hint="Equal volumes contain equal moles">Avogadro's law</span> states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules.</li>

      <li><span data-quiz="partial pressure" data-hint="Pressure contribution of one gas">Partial pressure</span> is the pressure that one gas in a mixture would exert if it occupied the entire volume alone.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="mole fraction" data-hint="Moles of component divided by total moles">Mole fraction</span> is the ratio of moles of one component to the total moles in a gas mixture.</li>
