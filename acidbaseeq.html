    ><br /><br />
    a.   Bronsted-Lowry focuses on proton transfer, while Lewis focuses on
    electron pair transfer<br />
    b.    Bronsted-Lowry focuses on electron pair transfer, while Lewis focuses on

    c.    Bronsted-Lowry focuses on hydrogen bonding, while Lewis focuses on ionic
    bonding<br />
    d.    Bronsted-Lowry focuses on ionic bonding, while Lewis focuses on hydrogen
    bonding<br /><br />
    2. In the reaction: NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-, is H2O acting as a Lewis acid?
    <span data-quiz="A"
      >Yes, because it accepts a pair of electrons from NH3</span
    ><br /><br />
    a.   Yes, because it accepts a pair of electrons from NH3<br />
    b.    Yes, because it donates a proton to NH3<br />
    c.    No, it would be OH- because it's the product of accepting the electron
    pair from NH3<br />
    d.    No, it would be NH4+ because it's the product of accepting a proton from
    H2O<br /><br />
