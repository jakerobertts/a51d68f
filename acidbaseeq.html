    1. Which of the following best describes the difference between the
    bronsted-lowry and lewis definitions of acids and bases?
    <span data-quiz="A"
      >Bronsted-Lowry focuses on proton transfer, while Lewis focuses on
      electron pair transfer</span
    ><br /><br />
    <strong>A.</strong>  Bronsted-Lowry focuses on proton transfer, while Lewis focuses on
    electron pair transfer<br />
    <strong>B.</strong>   Bronsted-Lowry focuses on electron pair transfer, while Lewis focuses on
    proton transfer<br />
    <strong>C.</strong>   Bronsted-Lowry focuses on hydrogen bonding, while Lewis focuses on ionic
    bonding<br />
    <strong>D.</strong>   Bronsted-Lowry focuses on ionic bonding, while Lewis focuses on hydrogen
    bonding<br /><br />
    2. In the reaction: NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-, is H2O acting as a Lewis acid?
    <span data-quiz="A"
      >Yes, because it accepts a pair of electrons from NH3</span
    ><br /><br />
    <strong>A.</strong>  Yes, because it accepts a pair of electrons from NH3<br />
    <strong>B.</strong>   Yes, because it donates a proton to NH3<br />
    <strong>C.</strong>   No, it would be OH- because it's the product of accepting the electron
    pair from NH3<br />
    <strong>D.</strong>   No, it would be NH4+ because it's the product of accepting a proton from
    H2O<br /><br />
