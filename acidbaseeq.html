    C) Bronsted-Lowry focuses on hydrogen bonding, while Lewis focuses on ionic
    bonding<br />
    D) Bronsted-Lowry focuses on ionic bonding, while Lewis focuses on hydrogen
    bonding<br /><br />
    2. In the reaction: NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4+ + OH-, is H2O acting as a Lewis acid?
    <span data-quiz="A"
      >Yes, because it accepts a pair of electrons from NH3</span
    ><br /><br />
    A) Yes, because it accepts a pair of electrons from NH3<br />
    B) Yes, because it donates a proton to NH3<br />
