    <h1>Renal System</h1>
    <h2>Kidneys</h2>
    <li>First, unfiltered blood enters the kidneys through the <span data-quiz="renal arteries">renal arteries</span>.</li>
    <li>Within the kidneys, blood is filtered in the nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidney.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The <span data-quiz="renal corpuscle">renal corpuscle</span> is the initial filtering component of the nephron.</li>
      <li>The <span data-quiz="renal tubule">renal tubule</span> is responsible for reabsorbing water and solutes from the filtrate.</li>
      <li>The <span data-quiz="loop of Henle">loop of Henle</span> is involved in concentrating urine by reabsorbing water and salts.</li>
      <li>The <span data-quiz="glomerulus">glomerulus</span> is a network of capillaries that filters blood in the renal corpuscle.</li>
      <li>The <span data-quiz="Bowmanâ€™s capsule">Bowmanâ€™s capsule</span> surrounds the glomerulus and collects the filtrate.</li>
      <li><span data-quiz="Fenestrated capillaries">Fenestrated capillaries</span> in the glomerulus allow for the passage of small molecules while retaining larger ones.</li>
      <li><span data-quiz="Podocytes">Podocytes</span> are specialized cells in the Bowmanâ€™s capsule that wrap around the glomerulus and help filter blood.</li>
    </ul>
        <li>The <span data-quiz="renal pelvis">renal pelvis</span> collects urine from the nephrons and transports it to the ureters.</li>
    <li>The <span data-quiz="renal cortex">renal cortex</span> is the outer layer of the kidney, containing the renal corpuscles and renal tubules.</li>
    <li>The <span data-quiz="renal medulla">renal medulla</span> is the inner layer of the kidney, containing the loops of Henle and the collecting ducts.</li>
    <li>The <span data-quiz="ureters">ureters</span> are tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</li>
    <li>The <span data-quiz="bladder">bladder</span> is a muscular sac that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted.</li>
    <li>The <span data-quiz="urethra">urethra</span> is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.</li>
    <h2>Nephron Function</h2>
