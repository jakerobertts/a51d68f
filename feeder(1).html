    <h1>Feeder Pathways</h1>
    <li>
      Feeder pathways are metabolic routes that provide substrates for central
      metabolic pathways like glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. They include
      pathways such as
      <span data-quiz="glycogenolysis" data-hint="Glycogen breakdown"
        >glycogenolysis</span
      >, and
      <span data-quiz="pentose phosphate" data-hint="Nucleotide synthesis"
        >the pentose phosphate</span
      >
      pathway.
    </li>
    <h2>Gluconeogenesis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate
        precursors, primarily occurring in the liver and kidneys.
      </li>
      <li>
        It involves reversing glycolysis, with some unique steps to bypass
        irreversible reactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first step is catalyzed by
        <span
          data-quiz="pyruvate carboxylase"
          data-hint="Converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate"
          >pyruvate carboxylase</span
        >, converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oxaloacetate is then converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by
        <span
          data-quiz="PEP carboxykinase"
          data-hint="Converts oxaloacetate to PEP"
          >PEP carboxykinase</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        The rate limiting step is catalyzed by
        <span
          data-quiz="fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"
          data-hint="Converts F-1,6-BP to F-6-P"
          >fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase</span
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
