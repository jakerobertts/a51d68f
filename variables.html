    <h1>Common Variables</h1>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="independent">independent</span> variable is the one
      that is changed or controlled in an experiment to test its effects on the
      <span data-quiz="dependent">dependent</span> variable.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="dependent">dependent</span> variable is the one that
      is measured in an experiment and is affected by the
      <span data-quiz="independent">independent</span> variable.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="control">control</span> variable is kept constant to
      ensure that the results are due to the independent variable only.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="confounding">confounding</span> variable is an
      outside influence that can affect the dependent variable, making it
      difficult to determine the true relationship between the independent and
      dependent variables.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="extraneous">extraneous</span> variable is any
      variable other than the independent variable that could influence the
      dependent variable, but is not of primary interest in the study.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="moderator">moderator</span> variable is a variable
      that affects the strength or direction of the relationship between the
      independent and dependent variables.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="mediator">mediator</span> variable is a variable that
      explains the mechanism through which the independent variable affects the
      dependent variable.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="operational">operational</span> definition is a
      clear, precise, and measurable definition of a variable that allows it to
      be tested and measured in an experiment.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="null">null</span> hypothesis is a statement that
      there is no effect or no difference, and it is tested against the
      alternative hypothesis, which states that there is an effect or a
      difference.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="alternative">alternative</span> hypothesis is a
      statement that there is an effect or a difference, and it is tested
      against the null hypothesis, which states that there is no effect or no
      difference.
    </li>
    <li>
      The sample size is the number of observations or data points collected in
      a study, which affects the reliability and validity of the results.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="significance">significance</span> level (alph<strong
        >A.</strong
      >
      is the threshold for determining whether a result is statistically
      significant, typically set at 0.05 or 0.01, indicating the probability of
      rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="p-value">p-value</span> is the probability of
      obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null
      hypothesis is true, and it is used to determine statistical significance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="confidence interval">confidence interval</span> is a
      range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter
      with a specified level of confidence, often 95% or 99%.
