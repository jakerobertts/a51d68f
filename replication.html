    <h1>DNA Replication</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          DNA replication is a <span data-quiz="semi-conservative" data-hint="Each new DNA molecule contains one old and one new strand">semi-conservative</span> process where each strand of the
          original DNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a new
          complementary strand.
        </li>
        <li>
          The process begins at specific locations called <span data-quiz="origins" data-hint="Starting points for DNA replication">origins</span> of replication,
          where the DNA double helix unwinds and separates into two single strands.
        </li>
        <li>
          The unwound region forms a <span data-quiz="replication fork" data-hint="Y-shaped structure where DNA strands separate">replication fork</span>, where new DNA strands are synthesized.
        </li>   
        <li>
            There are multiple origins of replication in eukaryotic cells, allowing for faster replication.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nucleic acids are synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning new nucleotides are added to the 3' end of the .
        </li>
        <li>
            Nucleic acids are coupled to the energy from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), which provide the necessary energy for the formation of <span data-quiz="phosphodiester" data-hint="Type of bond linking nucleotides">phosphodiester</span> bonds.
        </li>
        <li> 
            The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments called <span data-quiz="Okazaki" data-hint="Short DNA fragments on lagging strand">Okazaki fragments</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enzymes called <span data-quiz="DNA polymerases" data-hint="Enzymes that synthesize new DNA strands">DNA polymerases</span> synthesize new strands by adding nucleotides to the 3' carbon of the deoxyribose sugar,   
          complementary to the template strands, following base-pairing rules (A-T, C-G).
        </li>
        <li>
            Repair mechanisms include <span data-quiz="proofreading" data-hint="Error correction during DNA synthesis">proofreading</span> by DNA polymerases, which correct errors during synthesis, and <span data-quiz="mismatch repair" data-hint="Repair system fixing errors after replication">mismatch repair</span> systems that fix errors after replication.
        </li>
  <h2>Other Key Enzymes and Proteins in DNA Replication</h2>
        <li>
          <strong><span data-quiz="Helicase" data-hint="Enzyme that unwinds DNA">Helicase</span>:</strong> Unwinds the DNA double helix at the replication fork.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><span data-quiz="DNA Polymerase" data-hint="Main enzyme for DNA synthesis">DNA Polymerase</span>:</strong> Synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><span data-quiz="Primase" data-hint="Synthesizes RNA primers">Primase</span>:</strong> Synthesizes short RNA primers to initiate DNA synthesis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><span data-quiz="Ligase" data-hint="Joins DNA fragments together">Ligase</span>:</strong> Joins <span data-quiz="Okazaki" data-hint="Short DNA fragments on lagging strand">Okazaki</span> fragments on the lagging strand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Single-Strand Binding Proteins (SSBs):</strong> Stabilize unwound DNA strands
          to prevent them from re-<span data-quiz="annealing" data-hint="Rejoining of separated DNA strands">annealing</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><span data-quiz="Topoisomerase" data-hint="Relieves DNA tension">Topoisomerase</span>:</strong> Relieves torsional strain ahead of the replication fork
          by cutting and rejoining the DNA strands.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><span data-quiz="Sliding Clamp" data-hint="Holds DNA polymerase in place">Sliding Clamp</span> (PCNA in eukaryotes):</strong> Holds DNA polymerase in place on the
          template strand, increasing its processivity.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>While DNA polymerase synthesizes in the
      5'-3' direction, <span data-quiz="exonuclease">exonuclease</span> (another DNA polymerase) proofreads the newly synthesized
      DNA strand in the 3'-5' direction. Point and frameshift mutations (more
      harmful) are caused by errors in DNA polymerase. <span data-quiz="replication slippage">Replication slippage</span> is
      the process by which DNA polymerase temporarily dissociates from the
      template strand, leading to insertions or deletions.
