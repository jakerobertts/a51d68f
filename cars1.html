            <h2>Passage 1 (Questions 1‑5)</h2>
            To begin with, Plato was opposed to democracy for a few reasons. The
            only conditions for the Athenian democracy were, one had to be a
            man, born Greek, and own property. This did not sit well with Plato
            because to him it made no sense whatsoever. For instance, having
            many people decide who can rule with no political experience is like
            having many people choose who is going to fly an airplane. Only
            individuals that were professionally taught should be chosen from to
            fly an airplane. Plato believed Athenian democracy is a social
            disease and the only cure for it would be justice. According to
            Plato, the problems with democracy were universal incompetence and
            political selfishness.
            <br />
            First, the virtue of appetites equal to moderations is being able to
            control ones’ love of pleasure. This virtue would be associated with
            the productive class which is ranked the lowest class in the social
            positions of the just city. The productive class is ranked the
            lowest because it is governed by the love of money resulting in no
            political power. Although they would receive no political power,
            they will be able to obtain property. Doctors, lawyers, farmers, and
            architects are some examples of the types of people to be placed in
            this class.
            <br />
            Next, the virtue of passion equal to courage is the ability to
            control our anger and fear of danger. The virtue of passion is
            associated with the guardian class. The guardian class is filled
            with those who love honor for example the army or policemen. This
            class will not acquire any property, but they shall have relative
            power to protect and uphold the laws. The guardian class is ranked
            above the productive class due to their unity and team spirit.
            <br />
            Lastly, wisdom is associated with the wise. Wisdom is made up of two
            components, intellectual perfection and moral goodness. Those who
            are truly wise would not have any property neither would they care
            to have any. These are truly humble individuals who are absolutely
            at peace within themselves which is why they are ranked the highest
            in the just city. Typically, philosophers would be part of the wise
            class and be the only class to have absolute political power. He
            justifies the rule of the wise by arguing that wisdom represents the
            highest most noble condition of human nature and how a natural
            leader should be the one to lead. A wise individuals’ primary
            concern is their duty to society.
            <br />
            Eventually, Plato establishes requirements for what he considers
            necessary for the wise ruler. First, one must have general education
            until the age eighteen. Second, one must have two years military
            experience. Third, one must have completed ten years of math and
            science. Fourth, individuals must have completed four years of
            philosophy and finally, an individual needs fifteen years of admin
            experience in politics. Therefore, for a person to become a wise
            ruler they would have to be about fifty years old or over which was
            unfortunate because in that period people usually lived to about
            seventy years of age.

            leader should be the one to lead. A wise individuals' primary
            concern is their duty to society.
            <br /><br />
            Eventually, Plato establishes requirements for what he considers
            necessary for the wise ruler. First, one must have general education
            until the age eighteen. Second, one must have two years military
            experience. Third, one must have completed ten years of math and
            science. Fourth, individuals must have completed four years of
            philosophy and finally, an individual needs fifteen years of admin
            experience in politics. Therefore, for a person to become a wise
            ruler they would have to be about fifty years old or over which was
            unfortunate because in that period people usually lived to about
            seventy years of age.
