    <li>
      An
      <span data-quiz="Envelope" data-hint="Lipid membrane around some viruses"
        >Envelope</span
      >

    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Bacteriophages" data-hint="Viruses that infect bacteria"
        >Bacteriophages</span

    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="Retroviruses"
        data-hint="RNA viruses using reverse transcription"
        >Retroviruses</span
      >
      are RNA viruses that use reverse transcriptase to integrate into the host
      genome.
    </li>

    <h2>Viral Replication Cycles</h2>
    <li>
      The
      <span data-quiz="lytic cycle" data-hint="Immediate viral reproduction"
        >lytic cycle</span
      >
      results in immediate reproduction of the virus and destruction of the host
      cell.
    </li>
    <li>
      The
      <span data-quiz="lysogenic cycle" data-hint="Dormant viral integration"
        >lysogenic cycle</span
      >
      involves integration of viral DNA into the host chromosome, remaining
      dormant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Provirus" data-hint="Integrated viral DNA"
        >Provirus</span
      >
      is viral DNA that has been integrated into the host cell's chromosome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Viral load" data-hint="Virus concentration measurement"
        >Viral load</span
      >
      refers to the concentration of virus particles in a given sample.
    </li>

    <h2>Viral Proteins and Enzymes</h2>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Reverse transcriptase" data-hint="RNA-to-DNA enzyme"
        >Reverse transcriptase</span
      >
      is an enzyme that synthesizes DNA from an RNA template.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Integrase" data-hint="DNA insertion enzyme"
        >Integrase</span
      >
      is an enzyme that inserts viral DNA into the host cell's chromosome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Protease" data-hint="Protein-cleaving enzyme"
        >Protease</span
      >
      is an enzyme that cleaves viral proteins into functional components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Hemagglutinin" data-hint="Viral attachment protein"
        >Hemagglutinin</span
      >
      is a surface protein that allows viruses to attach to and enter host
      cells.
    </li>

    <h2>Other Infectious Agents</h2>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Prions" data-hint="Infectious protein particles"
        >Prions</span
      >
      are infectious protein particles that lack nucleic acid and cause
      neurodegenerative diseases.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Viroids" data-hint="Infectious RNA molecules"
        >Viroids</span
      >
      are small, circular RNA molecules that infect plants without a protein
      coat.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Transposons" data-hint="Jumping genes">Transposons</span>
      are DNA sequences that can move from one location to another within a
      genome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Plasmids" data-hint="Extra-chromosomal genetic elements"
        >Plasmids</span
      >

      chromosomes.
    </li>

    <h2>Host-Pathogen Interactions</h2>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Host range" data-hint="Specificity of viral infection"
