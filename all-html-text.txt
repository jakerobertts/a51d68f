    Acids and Bases
    
    
    
      Acids and bases are fundamental chemical concepts that describe proton transfer reactions and solution chemistry in aqueous systems.
      
      The Brønsted-Lowry definition describes acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors in chemical reactions.
      
      pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, providing a scale from 0-14 to measure acidity and basicity.
      
      Ka is the acid dissociation constant that quantifies the strength of an acid by measuring its degree of ionization.
      
      Kb is the base dissociation constant that quantifies the strength of a base by measuring its degree of ionization.
      
      pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, with lower pKa values indicating stronger acids.
      
      pKb is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant, with lower pKb values indicating stronger bases.
      
      Buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, consisting of weak acid-conjugate base pairs.
      
      Titration is an analytical technique where a solution of known concentration is gradually added to determine the concentration of another solution.
      
      The equivalence point in a titration is reached when the moles of acid equal the moles of base added.
      
      Indicators are compounds that change color at specific pH ranges, used to detect the endpoint of titrations.
      
      Neutralization reactions occur when acids and bases react to form salt and water, with the pH moving toward 7.
      
      Strong acid completely ionizes in aqueous solution, releasing all available protons and having very low pKa values.
      
      Weak acid only partially ionizes in aqueous solution, establishing an equilibrium between ionized and unionized forms.
      
      Conjugate pairs are acid-base pairs that differ by a single proton, related through proton transfer reactions.

    Isoelectric Point
    
    
      The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which an amino acid has no net charge.
        At pH below the pI, amino acids are positively charged; at pH above the pI, they are negatively charged.
        pI is calculated as the average of the pKa values of the carboxyl and amino groups.
        For amino acids with ionizable side chains, the pI is calculated using the pKa values of the side chain, carboxyl, and amino groups.

    Alleles & Genes
    
      A
      gene
      is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or functional RNA.
    
    
      An
      allele
      is a variant form of a gene that can result in different traits or
      phenotypes.
    
    
      For every gene in each human, there are
      two alleles, leading to genetic variation
      within a population.
    
    
      Alleles can be dominant or recessive. A
      dominant
      allele masks the effect of a recessive allele when both are present in an
      individual.
    
    
      An individual with two identical alleles for a trait is said to be
      homozygous, while an individual with
      two different alleles is
      heterozygous.
    
    
      A genotype is the genetic makeup of an
      individual, while a phenotype is the
      observable expression of that genotype.
    
    
      The wild-type allele is the most common
      form of a gene in a population, while mutant alleles are less common and
      can arise from mutations.
    
    
      A locus is the specific location of a gene
      on a chromosome, and alleles at a locus can vary in sequence, leading to

      Genetic Drift is the change in
      allele frequencies in a population due to random sampling events, which
      can lead to the loss of genetic variation over time.

    Coiling, Packing, Telomeres & Centromeres
    
      DNA is organized into a compact structure through coiling and packing,
      which is essential for fitting long DNA molecules into the cell nucleus.
      The key components include:
    

    
      
        Nucleosomes, which are fundamental
        units of DNA packaging, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone
        proteins.
      
      
        Chromatin, which is the complex of
        DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes during cell division.
      
      
        Telomeres, which are repetitive
        nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes that protect them from
        degradation and prevent fusion with other chromosomes.
        Telomerase is an enzyme that extends
        telomeres, allowing cells to divide without losing important genetic
        information.
      
      
        Centromeres, which are specialized
        regions of chromosomes that play a crucial role in chromosome
        segregation during cell division by serving as attachment points for
        spindle fibers.
      
      
        Heterochromatin is tightly
        packed and transcriptionally inactive, while
        euchromatin is loosely packed and
        transcriptionally active.
      
      
        Supercoiling is the twisting of DNA strands around each other, which can
        be either (overwound) or
        (underwound). It is
        important for DNA stability and regulation of gene expression.
        Topoisomerases are enzymes that
        manage DNA supercoiling by cutting and rejoining DNA strands to relieve
        torsional strain during DNA replication and transcription.

      Information-Processing model (Cognition) states that information is processed through a series of stages, including:
        
          Encoding involves transforming sensory input into a form that can be stored in memory.
          Storage refers to maintaining information over time.
          Retrieval is the process of accessing and bringing into consciousness information stored in memory.
        
    

    Cognitive Development Theories
    
      Piaget’s stages of cognitive development
      
        Sensorimotor stage is the stage where infants learn about the world through their senses and actions.
        Preoperational stage is characterized by the development of language and symbolic thinking, but lacking logical reasoning.
        Concrete operational stage involves the development of logical thought and the ability to perform operations on concrete objects.
        Formal operational stage is the stage where individuals develop the ability to think abstractly and hypothetically.
      
      Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory emphasizes the role of social interaction and cultural context in cognitive development.
      
        Zone of proximal development (ZPD) is the range of tasks that a child can perform with guidance but not independently.
        Scaffolding is the support provided by a more knowledgeable other to help a learner achieve tasks within their ZPD.
    
   

    Theories of Emotional Response

    Optics
    
    
    
      Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and optical instruments.
      
      Reflection occurs when light bounces off a surface, following the law that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
      
      Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index.
      
      Snell's law mathematically describes refraction, relating the angles and refractive indices of two media.
      
      Dispersion is the separation of white light into its component colors due to wavelength-dependent refraction.
      
      Total internal reflection occurs when light traveling from a denser to a less dense medium is completely reflected at the interface.
      
      Spherical mirrors are curved mirrors with surfaces that form part of a sphere, including both concave and convex mirrors.
      
      Focal length is the distance from a lens or mirror to the point where parallel rays converge or appear to diverge.
      
      Thin lenses are optical elements that refract light, with their behavior described by the thin lens equation relating object distance, image distance, and focal length.
      
      Diopters are the units used to measure the optical power of lenses, equal to the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.

    Types of Feedback Regulation
    
      
        Negative  feedback is a regulatory
        mechanism where the end product of a metabolic pathway inhibits an
        upstream process, preventing overproduction of the product. An example
        is the regulation of blood glucose levels, where high glucose levels
        stimulate insulin release, which in turn lowers blood glucose levels.
      
      
        Positive  feedback is a regulatory
        mechanism that amplifies the production of a product. This occurs in
        certain biological processes, such as reproduction, where the presence
        of a hormone stimulates the production of more hormones.

      Sensory Processing
    
        Sensation Threshold
        
          
            Absolute threshold is the minimum stimulation needed to detect a
            particular stimulus 50% of the time.
          
          
            Difference threshold (just noticeable difference) is the minimum
            difference between two stimuli required for detection 50% of the
            time.
          
        
          Weber’s Law is the principle that the just noticeable difference (JND)
          is a constant proportion of the original stimulus intensity.
        
        
          Signal Detection theory is a framework for understanding how we detect
          faint stimuli amidst background noise.
        
        
          Response Bias refers to the tendency to favor certain responses over others in the presence of uncertainty.
        
      
        
          Sensory Adaptation is the process by which our sensitivity to
          unchanging stimuli decreases over time.
        
        
          Psychophysics is the study of the relationship between physical
          stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce.
        
      
      Vision (Psychological Aspects)
      
        Visual processing
        
          Light and color perception is controlled by the retina and the visual cortex.
            Photoreceptors (rods and cones) convert light into neural signals.
            Color vision is based on the trichromatic theory and opponent-process theory.
            
          Visual pathways in the brain
            
                The visual cortex processes visual information from the retina.
                Visual processing involves multiple stages, including feature detection and pattern recognition.
            
          Parallel processing
          
            Parallel processing refers to the simultaneous processing of multiple aspects of a stimulus.
            Feature detection involves the identification of specific visual features, such as edges, angles, and movement.
            The magnocellular pathway is responsible for processing motion and depth information.
            The parvocellular pathway is responsible for processing color and fine detail.
          
        
      Hearing (Psychological Aspects)
      
        Auditory processing (e.g., auditory pathways in the brain)
        
          Sound waves are converted into neural signals by the cochlea.
          The auditory cortex processes auditory information from the cochlea.
          Auditory pathways in the brain involve multiple stages, including sound localization and frequency analysis.
          Impaired hearing can result in more mental health issues than impaired vision, such as depression and anxiety due to social isolation and communication difficulties.
        
      Other Senses (Psychological Aspects)
      
        Kinesthetic sense is the awareness of body movement.
        Proprioceptive sense is the awareness of body position.
        Vestibular sense is the sense of balance and spatial orientation.
      
      Perception
      
        Bottom-up processing is the analysis of the smaller features to build up to a complete perception without prior knowledge.
        Top-down processing is the use of pre-existing knowledge to organize individual features into a unified whole.
        Perceptual organization
         Monocular cues:
          
            Relative size is the perception that objects closer to us appear larger than those further away.
            Interposition is the perception that objects blocking others are closer to us.
            Relative clarity is the perception that clearer objects are closer, while hazy objects are further away.
            Texture gradient is the perception that objects with a coarse texture are closer, while those with a finer texture are further away.
            Relative height is the perception that objects higher in our field of vision are further away.
            Linear perspective is the perception that parallel lines appear to converge in the distance.
            Motion parallax is the perception that objects closer to us move faster than those further away as we move.
            Shading and contour are used to create the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality.
            Constancy is the perception that objects remain the same despite changes in sensory input.
          
          Binocular cues:
            
              Retinal disparity is the difference in images between the two eyes, which helps us perceive depth.
              Convergence is the inward angle of the eyes when focusing on a close object, which also aids in depth perception.
            
        
        Gestalt principles
        
          Proximity is the tendency to group nearby figures together.
          Similarity is the tendency to group similar figures together.
          Continuity is the tendency to perceive smooth, continuous patterns rather than discontinuous ones.
          Closure is the tendency to fill in gaps to create a complete, whole object.
          Pragnanz is the tendency to perceive complex images in the simplest form possible.
        
      
      
      Attention

        Intellectual functioning encompasses a range of cognitive abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, and planning.
      
      Consciousness
      
        States of consciousness
        
          Beta waves are associated with alertness and active thinking.
          Alpha waves are associated with relaxation and calmness.
          Theta waves are associated with light sleep and relaxation.
          Delta waves are associated with deep sleep and restorative processes.
        
        Sleep and circadian rhythms
        
          N1 is the lightest stage of sleep, where a person can be easily awakened.
          N2 is a deeper sleep stage characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes.
          N3 is the deepest stage of non-REM sleep, important for restorative processes.
          REM sleep is associated with vivid dreaming and increased brain activity.
        
        Hypnosis and meditation can alter states of consciousness and promote relaxation.
        Consciousness-altering drugs
        
          Stimulants increase alertness and energy (e.g., caffeine, amphetamines).
          Depressants reduce anxiety and promote relaxation (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines).
          Hallucinogens alter perception and can induce hallucinations (e.g., LSD, psilocybin).
          Opioids relieve pain and can induce feelings of euphoria (e.g., morphine, heroin).
          Cannabis can have both stimulant and depressant effects, depending on the dose and individual response.
        
      
      Memory
      
        Types of Memory
        
          Short-term memory holds information temporarily for processing.
          
            Iconic memory is a brief sensory memory for visual stimuli.
            Echoic memory is a brief sensory memory for auditory stimuli.
            Working memory is a system for temporarily holding and manipulating information.
            Phonological loop is a component of working memory that deals with auditory information.
            Visuospatial sketchpad is a component of working memory that deals with visual and spatial information.
            Central executive is the component of working memory that coordinates and manages the other components.
          

          Long term memory stores information more permanently.

        Encoding is the process of transforming information into a format that can be stored in memory.
        Storage is the process of maintaining information in memory over time.
        Retrieval is the process of accessing and bringing stored information into consciousness.
        Forgetting is the inability to retrieve information from memory.
      
      
    
      Emotion
      
        Three components of emotion

            The figure above illustrates the
            Yerkes Dodson Law, which
            describes the relationship between arousal and performance. Too much
            arousal can lead to decreased
            performance due to stress or anxiety. Too little can lead to boredom
            or lack of motivation. The middle of the vertical line represents
            the optimal level of arousal for peak performance. The Yerkes-Dodson
            Law validates the theory of
            optimal arousal in
            psychology.

    Transcription
    
      Transcription is the process of synthesizing
      RNA from a DNA template. It occurs in the
      nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The
      main steps include:
    

    
      
        Initiation: RNA polymerase binds to
        the
        <span

          >promoter</span
        >
        region of the gene, unwinding the DNA double helix.
      
      
        Elongation: RNA polymerase
        synthesizes a single-stranded RNA molecule by adding ribonucleotides
        complementary to the DNA template strand.
      
      
        Termination: RNA polymerase reaches
        a termination signal, causing it to detach from the DNA and release the
        newly synthesized RNA molecule.
      
    
    
      Transcription occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning RNA nucleotides
      are added to the 3' end of the growing RNA strand.
    
    
      Transcription occurs in the

    Post-transcriptional Modifications
    
      Post-transcriptional modifications are crucial for the maturation of
      eukaryotic mRNA. These modifications include:
    
      
        5'capping, where the 5' end is modified with a 7-methylguanylate cap
        Polyadenylation, which adds a poly(A) tail to the 3' end
        Splicing, where introns are removed and exons are joined together
        
          Alternative splicing, which allows for the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene.
        
         Introns are thought to contribute to evolution by allowing for alternative splicing and the creation of new protein variants.
        
            Ribozymes are RNA molecules that can catalyze their own splicing, playing a role in the removal of introns.
            Spliceosomes are large complexes made of RNA and protein that facilitate the splicing process by recognizing splice sites and catalyzing the removal of introns.
            snRNPs (small nuclear ribonuclearproteins) are components of spliceosomes that recognize specific sequences at the intron-exon boundaries, guiding the splicing process.
                snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs) are RNA molecules that are part of the spliceosome and play a crucial role in the splicing process by catalyzing the splicing reaction.

        can occur if oxygen is not available, converting pyruvate to lactate or
        ethanol, regenerating NAD⁺.
      
    
    Pyruvate Processing
    
      
        Pyruvate is transported into the
        mitochondria of the cell, where it
        is converted to acetyl-CoA by the
        pyruvate dehydrogenase
        complex.
      
      This process produces NADH and releases CO₂.

    Mechanics
    
    
    
      Mechanics studies the motion of objects and the forces that cause motion, including both translational motion and rotational motion.
      
      A force is any push or pull that can change an object's motion, measured in Newtons.
      
      When forces are balanced, an object remains at rest, meaning it has zero net acceleration.
      
      When a force acts on an object through a distance, work is done, transferring energy to or from the object.
      
      The capacity to do work is called energy, which exists in various forms including kinetic and potential.
      
      Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.
      
      Friction is a contact force that opposes the relative motion between surfaces in contact.
      
      The center of mass is the point where all the mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated.
      
      Forces can be analyzed using vector analysis, which accounts for both magnitude and direction.
      
      Rotational motion involves torques, which are forces applied at a distance from the axis of rotation.
      
      Simple machines provide mechanical advantage by allowing a smaller input force to produce a larger output force.
      
      Conservative forces do work that depends only on the starting and ending positions, not the path taken.
      
      Moving objects possess kinetic energy, which depends on their mass and velocity.
      
      Objects can store potential energy due to their position in a force field, such as gravitational or elastic potential energy.
      
      The conservation of energy principle states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
      
      The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred is called power, measured in watts.

    DNA Denaturation

    
      
        DNA denaturation is the process of separating the two strands of the
        double helix, typically induced by heat or chemical treatment.
      
      
        Reannealing occurs when the denatured strands come back together,
        forming a stable double helix again.
      
      
        Hybridization refers to the binding of complementary DNA or RNA strands
        from different sources, often used in techniques like blotting and
        microarray analysis.

    Thermodynamics
    
    
    
      Thermodynamics is the study of energy transfer and the relationship between heat, work, and temperature in physical systems.
      
      The thermodynamic laws are fundamental principles that govern energy transfer and entropy in all physical processes.
      
      PV diagrams graphically represent the relationship between pressure and volume during thermodynamic processes.
      
      Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, which always increases in isolated systems.
      
      Enthalpy represents the total heat content of a system at constant pressure, useful for analyzing chemical reactions.
      
      Calorimetry is the experimental technique used to measure heat changes during physical or chemical processes.
      
      Heat transfer occurs through conduction, convection, and radiation when there are temperature differences.
      
      Phase changes involve transitions between solid, liquid, and gas states with characteristic energy requirements.
      
      The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.
      
      The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.
      
      In isothermal processes, temperature remains constant while pressure and volume change.
      
      Adiabatic processes occur without heat exchange between the system and surroundings.
      
      Isobaric processes maintain constant pressure while temperature and volume change.
      
      Isochoric processes keep volume constant while pressure and temperature change.

    Spectroscopy
    
    
    
      Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation, used to identify and analyze molecular structure.
      
      Infrared radiation causes molecular vibrations, providing information about functional groups and bond types in molecules.
      
      IR spectroscopy uses infrared light to identify functional groups based on their characteristic vibrational frequencies.
      
      The fingerprint region is the area below 1500 cm⁻¹ in IR spectra that provides a unique pattern for each compound.
      
      Visible absorption occurs when molecules absorb light in the visible spectrum, often due to conjugated systems or colored compounds.
      
      UV absorption involves electronic transitions, particularly π→π* and n→π* transitions in molecules with double bonds or lone pairs.
      
      Conjugation refers to extended systems of alternating single and double bonds that lower energy gaps and shift UV absorption to longer wavelengths.
      
      NMR spectroscopy uses nuclear magnetic resonance to determine molecular structure by analyzing the magnetic environment of nuclei.
      
      Chemical shift is the position of an NMR peak relative to a reference standard, indicating the magnetic environment of the nucleus.
      
      Spin-spin splitting causes NMR peaks to split into multiple lines due to magnetic interactions with neighboring nuclei.
      
      Integration in NMR measures the area under peaks, which is proportional to the number of nuclei in that environment.

      Termination: The ribosome reaches a stop codon, and the completed
      polypeptide is released.
    
    
      The ribosome reads the mRNA in sets of three nucleotides called
      codons, each coding for a specific amino
      acid. The process involves:
    
    
      
        The ribosome has three sites: A (aminoacyl),
        P (peptidyl), and
        E (exit).
      
      
        tRNA molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome, matching
        their anticodon with the mRNA codon.
      
      
        rRNA in the ribosome catalyzes the formation of
        peptide bonds between adjacent
        amino acids, elongating the polypeptide chain.

    Fluids
    
    
    
      Fluids are substances that can flow and take the shape of their container, including both liquids and gases.
      
      The density of a fluid is its mass per unit volume, typically measured in kg/m³.
      
      Specific gravity compares the density of a substance to the density of water.
      
      Objects submerged in fluids experience buoyancy, an upward force that opposes gravity.
            
      The pressure at any depth in a static fluid is called hydrostatic pressure and increases with depth.
      
      Pascal's law states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.
      
      The resistance of a fluid to flow is called viscosity, with honey being more viscous than water.
      
      Poiseuille flow describes the smooth, laminar flow of viscous fluids through cylindrical tubes.
      
      The continuity equation states that the product of cross-sectional area and velocity remains constant for incompressible flow.
      
      At high velocities, smooth flow can break down into chaotic turbulence with swirling eddies.
      
      Surface tension is the cohesive force that acts on the surface of liquids, allowing some insects to walk on water.
      
      Bernoulli's equation describes how pressure decreases when the speed of a fluid increases.

    Mitosis & Meiosis Overview
    
      Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical
      daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent
      cell.
    
    
      Mitosis and meiosis both involve the replication of DNA and the separation
      of chromosomes.
    
    
      Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that reduces the chromosome
      number by half, resulting in four non-identical gametes (sperm or eggs)
      with half the number of chromosomes.
    
    
      
        During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are separated into different
        gametes, ensuring genetic diversity.
      
      
        Crossing over can occur during prophase I of meiosis, allowing for the
        exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes.
      
      
        
          Single crossover involves the exchange of genetic material between two
          homologous chromosomes at one location.
        
        
          Double crossover involves two crossover events, where segments of
          genetic material are exchanged at two locations on homologous
          chromosomes.
        
      
      
        The synaptonemal complex forms during prophase I of meiosis,
        facilitating the pairing of homologous chromosomes and the exchange of
        genetic material.
      
      
        A tetrad is a structure formed during meiosis when homologous
        chromosomes pair up, consisting of four chromatids (two from each
        homologous chromosome).

    Metabolic Pathway Regulation
    
      Metabolic pathways are regulated by various mechanisms to maintain
      homeostasis and respond to cellular
      needs. Homeostasis that is maintained for a prolonged period is called a
      steady state.
    
    
      Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation are key
      metabolic pathways that are tightly regulated.
    
    
      Enzymes in these pathways can be regulated by allosteric effectors,
      covalent modifications, and feedback inhibition.
    
    
      Hormones such as insulin and
      glucagon play crucial roles in
      regulating glucose metabolism and energy balance in the body.
    
    
      Insulin promotes glucose uptake and
      storage, while glucagon stimulates
      gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to increase blood glucose levels.
    
    
      They are both produced by the
      pancreas and have opposing effects on
      glucose metabolism.

            Otolith organs: detect linear acceleration
          
        
      
      
        Hair cells are specialized mechanoreceptors in the cochlea that convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals through deflection of stereocilia, enabling hearing.
      
    

    Other Senses (Biological Aspects)

    
      
        Somatosensation is the body's sense of touch, pressure,
        temperature, and pain perception through specialized receptors in skin,
        muscles, and internal organs.
      
      
        
          Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement,
          mediated by proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints.
        
        
          Nociception is the sensory process that detects pain through
          nociceptors, specialized receptors that respond to potentially damaging
          stimuli.
        
        
          Thermoreception is the ability to sense temperature changes
          through thermoreceptors in the skin and other tissues.
        
      
      
        Taste is chemoreception by taste buds containing receptor
        cells that detect five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and
        umami (savory).
      
      
        
          Fungiform papillae are mushroom-shaped structures on the tongue that contain taste buds, primarily responsible for detecting sweet and salty tastes.
        
        
          Foliate papillae are folds on the sides of the tongue that contain taste buds, primarily responsible for detecting sour tastes.
        
        
          Circumvallate papillae are large, dome-shaped structures at the back of the tongue that contain taste buds, primarily responsible for detecting bitter tastes.
        
      
      
        Smell is chemoreception by olfactory cells in the nasal
        cavity that detect airborne chemical molecules and send signals directly
        to the olfactory bulb in the brain.
      
    
    
      
        Pheromones are chemical signals released by organisms that
        trigger behavioral or physiological responses in other members of the
        same species, important in reproduction and social behavior.
      
      
        Olfactory pathways in the brain: 
        
          Olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity send signals to the olfactory bulb

          Connects directly to the limbic system (emotion and memory centers)
          Does not pass through the thalamus
        
      
    

    Neural Basis of Memory & Learning

    
      
        <strong
          >Changes in synaptic connections underlie memory and learning:</strong
        >
        Memory formation involves strengthening or weakening synaptic
        connections through mechanisms:
        
          Long-term potentiation  is the strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity.
          Long-term depression  is the weakening of synapses based on the absence or decrease of activity.
        
      
      
        Neural plasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize
        and adapt by forming new neural connections, modifying existing ones,
        and even generating new neurons throughout life.
      
    

    Processes in Emotion

    
      
        The role of biological processes in perceiving emotion:
        Emotions involve complex interactions between neurotransmitters:
        
          Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, influencing motivation and mood.
          Norepinephrine is involved in arousal and alertness, affecting the body's response to stress.
          Serotonin is linked to mood regulation, and its imbalance is associated with depression and anxiety.
        
        and brain
        structures:
        
          The Amygdala is involved in fear processing and emotional responses.
          The Prefrontal Cortex is responsible for emotional regulation and decision-making.
          The Hippocampus plays a role in emotional memory and context.
        
      
      
    
    
      
        <strong
          >Regions involved in the generation and experience of
          emotions:</strong
        >
        Primarily components of the limbic system including amygdala,
        hippocampus, cingulate cortex,
        and associated structures.
      
      
        The limbic system processes
        emotional responses, links emotions to memories, and coordinates
        emotional behavior with the autonomic nervous system.
      
      
        Emotion and the autonomic nervous system:
        
          The Sympathetic division triggers "fight-or-flight" responses.
          The Parasympathetic division promotes "rest-and-digest" states.
        
      
      
        Physiological markers of emotion: Measurable changes
        include heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, cortisol levels,
        and facial muscle activity.
      
      
        Physiological Response to Stress:
        Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.
      
    

    Nervous System

    
      
        The nervous system is divided into
        
          Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
          Peripheral nervous system (all nerves outside).
        
        which are responsible for controlling and coordinating body functions.
      
      
        Neurons: Nerve cells consist of:
        
          Dendrites (receive signals)
          Cell body/soma (processes signals)
          Axon (transmits signals)
        
        forming the basic functional unit of the nervous system.
      
      
       Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit
        signals across synapses between neurons, including:
        
          Acetylcholine
          Dopamine
          Serotonin
          GABA
          Glutamate
        
      
      
        Structure and function of the peripheral nervous system:
        
          Somatic nervous system (voluntary motor control)
          Autonomic nervous system (involuntary functions like heart rate, digestion).
        
      
      
        Structure and function of the central nervous system:
        
            Brain (processing center for sensory information, emotions, cognition)
            Spinal cord (transmits signals between brain and body, coordinates reflexes).

      
    
    The brain
    
      
        Forebrain:
        
          The Cerebrum is involved in higher cognitive functions, and consciousness
          The Thalamus is the sensory relay center
          The Hypothalamus is responsible for homeostasis and hormone regulation.
        
      
      
        Midbrain:
        
          Structures involved in visual and auditory reflexes, eye movement, and parts of the reticular formation that regulate arousal and consciousness.
        
      
      
        Hindbrain: Includes the:
        
          Cerebellum (coordination, balance)
          Pons (sleep, arousal, facial sensation)
          Medulla oblongata (vital functions like breathing, heart rate)
        
      
      
        Lateralization of cortical functions: Specialization of
        brain hemispheres:
        
          
            The left hemisphere is typically associated with language, analytical thinking, and logical reasoning.
          
          
            The right hemisphere is associated with spatial processing, creativity, and holistic thinking.
          
        
      
      
        Methods used in studying the brain:
        
          Functional MRI which measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow.
          PET scans which use radioactive tracers to visualize brain activity.
          EEG which records electrical activity of the brain through electrodes on the scalp.
          CT scans which provide detailed images of brain structure using X-rays.
          Lesion studies which involve examining the effects of brain damage on behavior.
          Electrophysiology which measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes.
        
      
    
    The spinal cord
    
      
        Structure and function of the spinal cord:
        
          Gray matter (cell bodies) forms the central butterfly shape.
          White matter (myelinated axons) surrounds it, organizing ascending and descending pathways for sensory and motor information.
        
      
      
        Spinal reflexes are automatic responses that occur at the
        spinal cord level without brain involvement and include:
        
            Stretch reflex (e.g., knee-jerk reflex)
            Withdrawal reflex (e.g., pulling back from a painful stimulus)
        
      
    

    The endocrine system

    
      
        Components of the endocrine system:
        
        Hypothalamus (regulates pituitary gland through the HPA axis)
          Pituitary gland (master gland)
          Thyroid gland (metabolism)
          Adrenal glands (stress response)
          Pancreas (blood sugar)
          Gonads (reproduction)
        
      
      
        Effects of the endocrine system on behavior: There are several hormones that influence behavior, including:
        
          Adrenaline (increases arousal and energy)
          Cortisol (regulates stress response)
          Oxytocin (promotes bonding and social behaviors)
          Testosterone (associated with aggression and dominance)
          Estrogen (involved in reproductive functions and mood regulation)
          Melatonin (regulates sleep-wake cycles)
        
      
    

    Behavioral Genetics

    
      
        Genes, temperament, and heredity: Genetic variations
        influence personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and predispositions
        to certain behaviors through inherited DNA sequences.
      
      
        Adaptive value of traits and behaviors: Behaviors and
        traits that enhance survival and reproductive success are favored by
        natural selection and become more common in populations.
      
      
        Interaction between heredity and environmental influences:
        Gene-environment interactions determine how genetic predispositions are
        expressed, with environment modulating genetic effects.
      
    
    
      
        Regulatory genes and behavior: Genes that control the
        expression of other genes, influencing when and where behavioral
        programs are activated during development and in response to stimuli.
      
      
        Genetically based behavioral variation in natural populations:
        Genetic diversity within species creates behavioral differences that may

    Human Physiological Development

    
      
        Prenatal development: Development from fertilization to
        birth, including embryonic stage (organ formation) and fetal stage
        (growth and maturation), with critical periods for normal development.
        
            Fertilization: The union of sperm and egg
            
                Acrosome reaction: Enzymes from the sperm penetrate the egg's outer layer
                Cortical reaction: Egg releases enzymes to prevent multiple sperm from entering
                Zygote: The fertilized egg that undergoes cell division
                Blastocyst: A hollow ball of cells that implants in the uterine wall

            
          Embryonic stage: Major organs and structures form (weeks 3-8)
          
            Neural tube forms (week 3)
            Heart begins to beat (week 4)
            Limbs and facial features develop (weeks 5-8)
          
          Fetal stage: Growth and maturation of organs (weeks 9-40)
      
      
      
        
        Motor development: Progressive acquisition of movement
        skills from basic reflexes in infancy to complex coordinated movements,
        following predictable developmental sequences.
        
          Reflexes (e.g., grasping, rooting) are present at birth.
          Gross motor skills (e.g., crawling, walking) develop in early childhood.
          Fine motor skills (e.g., grasping small objects, writing) develop later in childhood.
        
      
      
        Developmental changes in adolescence: Puberty triggers
        hormonal changes, physical growth spurts, sexual maturation, and
        continued brain development, especially prefrontal cortex maturation.
        
            Puberty: The period during which adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction.

        
      
    

    Biological Bases of Disorders & Therapies

    
      
        Biological bases of nervous system disorders (Schizophrenia,
        Depression, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease)
      
      
        Neurotransmitter imbalances: Abnormal levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, serotonin) are implicated in these disorders.
        Genetic factors: Hereditary components contribute to the risk of developing these conditions.
        Brain structure abnormalities: Differences in brain anatomy (e.g., enlarged ventricles in schizophrenia) are observed.
      
      
        Stem cell-based therapy to regenerate neurons in the central nervous
        system:
        
          Stem cells can differentiate into various cell types, including neurons, offering potential for
            repairing damaged brain tissue.
          Research is ongoing to develop effective methods for delivering stem cells to the brain and
            ensuring their survival and integration into existing neural networks.
        
      
    

    Biological Processes in Motivation

    
      
        Drives: Biological needs that create internal tension
        and motivate behavior to restore homeostasis, operating through negative
        feedback systems (e.g., hunger drive when blood glucose drops).
      
      
        Incentives: External stimuli or rewards that
        motivate behavior by providing positive reinforcement (e.g., food, social approval).
      
      
        Biological and sociocultural motivators that regulate behavior:
        
          Hunger involves hypothalamic regulation and hormones:
          
            Ghrelin stimulates appetite
            Leptin signals satiety
          
          Sex drive involves hormones and brain reward systems;
          Addiction involves dopamine pathways and neuroplasticity.
        
      
    

    Biological Processes in Learning

    
      
        Classical conditioning (Biological aspects):
        Involves synaptic changes in brain circuits that link conditioned and
        unconditioned stimuli, with the amygdala playing key roles in fear
        conditioning.
      
      
        Operant conditioning (Biological aspects): Relies on
        brain reward systems that strengthen
        behaviors followed by positive outcomes and weaken those followed by
        negative outcomes.
      
    
    
      
        Biological processes that affect associative learning:
        Biological predispositions make some associations easier to learn:
        
          Taste aversion is a learned avoidance of a particular food that has been associated with illness.
            Preparedness refers to the innate predisposition to learn certain associations more easily than others, such as associating snakes with fear.
            Instinctive drift causes learned behaviors to revert to species-typical patterns.
        
      
      
        Biological processes that affect observational learning:
        
          Mirror neurons are specialized neurons that fire when an individual performs an action and when they observe the same action performed by others, facilitating imitation and learning.
          Social learning involves observing and imitating others, with mirror neurons playing a key role in understanding and replicating behaviors.
        
      
    
  

Animal Social Behavior (Biological Aspects)

    
      
        Animal signals and communication:
        
          Chemical signals known as pheromones
          Visual displays:
            
                Coloration (e.g., bright colors in birds)
                Body language (e.g., tail position in dogs)
                Mating displays (e.g., courtship rituals)
                Threat displays (e.g., puffing up in pufferfish)
            
          Auditory signals
          
            Vocalizations (e.g., bird songs, wolf howls)
            Calls (e.g., alarm calls in primates)
          
        
      
      
        Biological explanations of social behavior in animals:
        Social behaviors have evolutionary origins and genetic bases, often
        serving functions like:
        
          Mate selection: where individuals choose mates based on specific traits.
          Territory defense involves behaviors that protect an area from intruders.
          Predator avoidance includes strategies to evade or deter predators.
          Cooperative resource acquisition refers to group behaviors that enhance foraging success.
        
      
      
        Foraging behavior: Food-seeking strategies that balance
        energy costs and benefits, following optimal foraging theory to maximize
        energy gain while minimizing risks and energy expenditure.
      
    
    
      
        Applying game theory: Mathematical models used to
        predict behavioral strategies in competitive and cooperative situations,
        helping explain phenomena like aggression, cooperation, and resource
        sharing.
      
      
        Altruism: Behaviors that benefit others at a cost to
        the individual, explained through kin selection (helping relatives) and
        reciprocal altruism (helping others who may return the favor).
      
      
        Inclusive fitness: An individual's total genetic
        contribution to future generations, including both personal reproduction
        and the reproduction of relatives (who share genes), explaining
        altruistic behaviors.

    Fats
    
    
      Fats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. They are a source of energy and help your body absorb vitamins.
      Digestion, mobilization, and transport of fats occur in the mouth/stomach, small intestine, adipocytes, and blood.
      Digestion begins in the mouth/stomach with lingual and gastric lipases, mainly occurring in the small intestine with pancreatic lipases aided by bile salts.
      Products from digestion form micelles, which diffuse into enterocytes, re-esterify into triglycerides, and finally pack into chylomicrons, and enter lymphatic blood.
      Lipase in adipocytes activates by glucagon/epinephrine, liberating fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids bind albumin for transport.
      Chylomicrons are molecules that carry dietary fats, VLDL transports endogenously made triglycerides, and LDL/HDLs handle cholesterol. Free fatty acids circulate bound to albumin.
      Oxidation of fatty acids occurs in mitochondria (and peroxisomes/ER for special cases), breaking down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH₂.
        Fatty acids break down into acyl-CoA via synthetase
        Long-chain fatty acids use the carnitine shuttle to enter mitochondria
      Each cycle releases NADH, FADH₂, and acetyl-CoA, entering the TCA cycle and yielding ~120 ATP from stearate (C18).
      Unsaturated & odd/very-long chains require auxiliary enzymes and peroxisomal processing. They contribute to the fluidity of the cell-membrane
      Saturated fatty acids are primarily metabolized in the mitochondria via β-oxidation. They are beneficial to the cell membrane in low temperatures.
      Lipogenesis is stimulated by the hormone insulin and inhibited by glucagon.
      Lipids are synthesized in the cell's cytoplasm.
      Fatty acid synthesis involves acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH.

    Stoichiometry
    
    
    
      Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions based on the balanced chemical equation and mole relationships.
      
      The molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in one molecule of a compound.
      
      The empirical formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.
      
      Percent composition gives the mass percentage of each element in a compound based on its molecular formula.
      
      A mole is a unit representing 6.022 × 10²³ particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units) of a substance.
      
      Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance, often used in stoichiometric calculations involving gases and solutions.
      
      Oxidation numbers are assigned to atoms to keep track of electron transfer in chemical reactions and help balance redox equations.
      
      Balancing equations ensures that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides of a chemical equation.
      
      The limiting reagent is the reactant that is completely consumed first and determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed.
      
      Theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can be produced from given amounts of reactants, calculated from the balanced equation.
      
      Percent yield compares the actual yield obtained in an experiment to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.

      Social Influence
      
        Social control is the regulation of individual behavior by social norms and rules.
        Peer pressure is the influence exerted by a peer group to encourage conformity to group norms.
        Conformity is the adjustment of individual behavior to align with group norms.
        
          Asch's experiments on conformity demonstrated the power of group pressure on individual decision-making.
        
        Obedience is the compliance with the commands of an authority figure.
        
          Milgram's experiments on obedience revealed the extent to which individuals would follow authority figures, even against their own ethical beliefs.
      
      Group Dynamics
      
        Group Decision-Making Processes:
        
          Groupthink is a phenomenon where the desire for harmony in a group leads to irrational or dysfunctional decision-making.
          Group polarization is the tendency for group members to make more extreme decisions than individuals would make alone.
          Social facilitation is the tendency for individuals to perform better on tasks when in the presence of others.
          Social loafing is the tendency for individuals to exert less effort when working in a group compared to when working alone.
        
      
      Norms & Deviance
      
        Normative behavior refers to actions that align with societal expectations and norms.
        Social norms are the accepted standards of behavior within a society.
        Sanctions are penalties or rewards for adhering to or violating social norms.
        Folkways are informal norms that govern everyday behavior, while mores are more serious norms that carry moral significance.
        Laws are formalized norms that are enforced by the state.
        Taboos are strong prohibitions against certain behaviors that are considered morally or ethically unacceptable.
        Anomie is a state of normlessness that can occur during periods of social change.
        Deviance refers to behavior that violates social norms.
        
          Aspects of collective behavior:
      
        Collective behavior refers to the actions and behaviors of a group of people in response to a shared event or situation.
        Riots are spontaneous and violent outbursts of collective behavior, often in response to perceived injustices or grievances.
        Fads are temporary, widely adopted behaviors or trends that quickly gain popularity and then fade away.
        Mass hysteria is a phenomenon where a group of people exhibit similar symptoms or behaviors in response to a perceived threat or fear.
      
      Socialization
      
        Socialization is the lifelong process through which individuals learn and internalize the values, beliefs, and norms of their culture and society.
        
          Agents of socialization:
          
            Family is the primary agent of socialization, shaping an individual's early values and beliefs.
            Schools play a crucial role in teaching formal knowledge and social skills.
            Peers provide a sense of belonging and influence behavior during adolescence.
            Media serves as a powerful agent of socialization, shaping perceptions and attitudes through various forms of communication.
            Religion can influence values, beliefs, and behaviors, providing a moral framework for individuals.
          
        
      
      Identity (Social Aspects)
      
        
          Different types of identities:
          
            Personal identity refers to an individual's unique characteristics and experiences.
            Social identity is derived from an individual's membership in social groups (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender).
            Role identity is based on the roles individuals play in society (e.g., parent, student, employee).
            Collective identity refers to the shared identity of a group based on common characteristics or experiences.
          
            Race is a socially constructed category based on perceived physical differences.
            Ethnicity refers to shared cultural practices, perspectives, and distinctions that set apart one group of people from another.

          
        
        Influence of groups:
        
          Reference groups are groups that individuals use as a standard for evaluating themselves and their behavior.
          In-groups are groups to which an individual feels a sense of belonging, while out-groups are those to which they do not belong.
          Social comparison is the process of comparing oneself to others to evaluate one's own abilities and opinions.
        
        Influence of culture and socialization on identity formation:
        
          Cultural norms and values shape individual identities by providing a framework for behavior and expectations.
          Socialization processes, such as family upbringing and education, contribute to the development of personal and social identities.
        
      
      Prejudice & Bias
      
        Prejudice refers to preconceived opinions or attitudes about individuals or groups, often based on stereotypes.
        Biases
        
          Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect understanding, actions, and decisions.
          Explicit bias refers to the attitudes or beliefs that one endorses at a conscious level.
          Confirmation bias can lead individuals to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs about a group.
          Discrimination is the unfair treatment of individuals based on their group membership, which can manifest in various forms, including individual and institutional discrimination.
          Social categorization is the process of classifying people into groups based on shared characteristics, which can lead to in-group bias and out-group derogation.
          Belief perseverance is the tendency to hold on to one's beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence.
        
        
          Processes that contribute to prejudice:
          
            Power is the ability to influence or control others, often leading to the perpetuation of stereotypes and discrimination.
            Prestige refers to the respect and admiration that an individual or group commands, which can influence perceptions and treatment of others.
            Class refers to the social stratification based on economic status, which can impact access to resources and opportunities, contributing to systemic discrimination.
          
        Stigma is the social disapproval or discrimination against individuals based on perceivable social characteristics, often leading to marginalization.
        Ethnocentrism is the belief in the superiority of one's own culture or ethnic group, often accompanied by a disdain for other cultures.
        Cultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that individual's own culture, rather than judged against the standards of another.
      
      Social Interaction & Structure
      
        Elements of Social Interaction
        
          Social roles are the expected behaviors associated with a particular position in society.
          Status refers to a person's social position within a group or society, which can be achieved or ascribed.
           
          Ascribed status is a social position assigned at birth or involuntarily later in life, such as race, gender, or ethnicity.
          Achieved status is a social position that an individual attains as a result of their actions, efforts, or accomplishments.
        
          Role conflict occurs when an individual faces competing demands from different roles, while role strain arises from conflicting expectations within a single role.
          Role exit is the process of disengaging from a role that has been central to one's identity.
        Primary groups are small, intimate groups characterized by close, personal relationships (e.g., family, close friends).
        Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal groups that are task-oriented and less emotionally connected (e.g., coworkers, classmates).
        A dyad is a social group consisting of two members.
        A triad is a social group consisting of three members, which can lead to more complex dynamics than a dyad.
       Social networks are the web of social relationships that connect individuals and groups.
        Utilitarian organizations are structured to achieve specific goals and provide material rewards (e.g., businesses, government agencies).
        Normative organizations are formed to pursue shared interests or goals, often providing intangible rewards (e.g., religious groups, political parties).
        Coercive organizations are characterized by involuntary membership and strict control (e.g., prisons, mental institutions).
        Bureaucracies are formal organizations characterized by a hierarchical structure, clear rules and procedures, and a division of labor.
        
      
      Self-Presentation (Sociological Aspect)
      
        The dramaturgical approach to self-presentation suggests that individuals perform roles in social interactions, using impression management to influence how they are perceived by others.
        Front stage refers to the public performance of self, where individuals present themselves in a manner that aligns with societal expectations.
        Back stage refers to the private, less formal aspects of self-presentation, where individuals can relax and be themselves without the pressure of public scrutiny.
        Impression management is the conscious or unconscious effort to influence how others perceive us, often through self-presentation strategies such as self-disclosure, flattery, and conformity to social norms.

        Enzymes are highly specific, meaning they only catalyze specific
        reactions or act on specific substrates.

        of an enzyme is the region where the substrate binds, and it is
        typically a small pocket or groove on the enzyme's surface.
      
      
        Enzyme activity can be affected by factors such as temperature, pH, and
        substrate concentration.
      
    
    Enzyme Kinetics
    
    
      
        Enzyme kinetics is the study of the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
        and how they change in response to various factors.
      
      
        The mechanism of catalysis involves the formation of an

            Cooperativity can be visualized using a
            sigmoidal
            curve, which indicates that the enzyme's activity increases more
            rapidly at certain substrate concentrations.
        
        
            Cooperativity is measured by the Hill coefficient, which
            quantifies the degree of cooperativity in enzyme activity.
        
      Enzyme Inhibition
     
      
        Enzyme inhibitors can be classified as competitive, non-competitive, or
        uncompetitive based on their mechanism of action.
   
    
      Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme, preventing
      substrate binding.
    
    
      Non-competitive inhibitors
      reduce the enzyme's activity without affecting substrate binding.
    
    
      Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate  complex, preventing
      the conversion of substrate to product.

    Sex-Linked Characteristics
    
      X-inactivation is a process where one of the
      two X chromosomes in female mammals is randomly inactivated, leading to
      dosage compensation between males and females.
    
    
      Males are more likely to express
      recessive traits linked to the X
      chromosome because they have only one X chromosome, while females have two
      and can be carriers without expressing the trait.
    
    
      Sex is determined by X and Y chromosomes,
      with males having one X and one Y
      chromosome, and females having two X
      chromosomes.
    
    
      There are very few genes on the Y chromosome, which is why
      Y-linked traits are much rarer than
      X-linked traits.

    Functional Groups
    
    
    
      Functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms that give organic molecules their characteristic chemical properties and reactivity patterns.
      
      Aldehydes contain a carbonyl group bonded to at least one hydrogen atom, with the general structure R-CHO.
      
      Ketones contain a carbonyl group bonded to two carbon atoms, with the general structure R-CO-R.
      
      Alcohols contain a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom, making them polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
      
      Carboxylic acids contain a carboxyl group (-COOH) that can donate protons, making them acidic compounds.
      
      Esters are formed from the reaction between carboxylic acids and alcohols, with the general structure R-COO-R.
      
      Amides contain a carbonyl group bonded to a nitrogen atom, commonly found in proteins and synthetic polymers.
      
      Phenols are aromatic alcohols with a hydroxyl group directly attached to a benzene ring, making them more acidic than regular alcohols.
      
      Aromatic compounds contain benzene rings or similar cyclic, planar structures with delocalized electrons.
      
      Heterocyclic compounds are ring structures that contain atoms other than carbon, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur.
      
      Oxidation reactions involve the loss of electrons, often converting alcohols to aldehydes/ketones or aldehydes to carboxylic acids.
      
      Reduction reactions involve the gain of electrons, often converting carbonyl groups to alcohols using reducing agents.
      
      Substitution reactions involve the replacement of one functional group or atom with another in organic molecules.
      
      Addition reactions involve the addition of atoms or groups across carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.
      
      Elimination reactions involve the removal of groups from adjacent carbons to form carbon-carbon double bonds.
      
      Aldol condensation is a reaction between aldehydes and ketones that forms carbon-carbon bonds, important in biosynthesis.
      
      Esterification is the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol to form an ester and water.
      
      Hydrolysis reactions use water to break chemical bonds, such as converting esters back to acids and alcohols.

    Nucleotides & Nucleosides
    
      
        
          Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and
          consist of a nitrogenous base, a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and
          one or more phosphate groups.
        
        
          Nucleosides are similar to nucleotides but lack the phosphate group.
        
        
            The sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleic acids is formed by
            phosphodiester
            linkages between the 3' hydroxyl group of one sugar and the 5'
            phosphate group of the next sugar.
        
        
          Nitrogenous bases can be classified as purines (adenine and guanine) or
          pyrimidines (cytosine, uracil, and thymine).
        
        
            Purines have a two-ring structure, while pyrimidines have a single-ring structure.
        
        
          The sequence of nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids encodes genetic
          information, with specific base pairing rules (A-T and G-C in DNA; A-U and G-C in RNA).
        
        
            GC bonds are the strongest base pairs due to three hydrogen bonds.
        
        
            Nucleotides include DNA, RNA, ATP (involves energy transfer), and cAMP (involved in signaling), each serving different roles in cellular processes.
        
        
            DNA functions to store and transmit genetic information, while RNA plays roles in protein synthesis and regulation.

    The Triplet Code
    
      Each amino acid is encoded by a sequence of three nucleotides in the mRNA,
      known as a
      codon. Multiple
      codons can code for the same
      amino acid, which is a key feature of
      the genetic code.
    
      
        Wobble base pairing allows for some
        flexibility in the third position of the codon, enabling a single tRNA
        to recognize multiple codons that code for the same amino acid.
      
      
        Missense mutations change one amino
        acid in the protein sequence, while
        silent mutations do not change the amino
        acid sequence due to redundancy in the genetic code.
      
      
        Nonsense mutations introduce a
        premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.

    Oxidative Stress & the Mitochondria
    
      Oxidative stress occurs when
      there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify them, leading to potential damage
      to cells and tissues.
    
    
      The mitochondria are a major source of ROS, particularly during

    DNA Replication
    
      
        
          DNA replication is a semi-conservative process where each strand of the
          original DNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a new
          complementary strand.
        
        
          The process begins at specific locations called origins of replication,
          where the DNA double helix unwinds and separates into two single strands.
        
        
          The unwound region forms a replication fork, where new DNA strands are synthesized.
           
        
            There are multiple origins of replication in eukaryotic cells, allowing for faster replication.
        
        
            Nucleic acids are synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning new nucleotides are added to the 3' end of the .
        
        
            Nucleic acids are coupled to the energy from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), which provide the necessary energy for the formation of phosphodiester bonds.
        
         
            The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments called Okazaki fragments.
        
        
          Enzymes called DNA polymerases synthesize new strands by adding nucleotides to the 3' carbon of the deoxyribose sugar,   
          complementary to the template strands, following base-pairing rules (A-T, C-G).
        
        
            Repair mechanisms include proofreading by DNA polymerases, which correct errors during synthesis, and mismatch repair systems that fix errors after replication.
        
  Other Key Enzymes and Proteins in DNA Replication
        
          Helicase: Unwinds the DNA double helix at the replication fork.

          Single-Strand Binding Proteins (SSBs): Stabilize unwound DNA strands
          to prevent them from re-annealing.

    Organ Systems Overview
    
    The Nervous System

    Neural Cells
    
      Astrocytes: Provide structural
      support, regulate blood flow, and maintain the blood-brain barrier.
    
    
      Microglia: Act as immune cells in the
      CNS. Consists of small, mobile cells that can phagocytize debris and
      pathogens.
    
    
      Oligodendrocytes: Myelinate CNS
      axons.
    
    
      Schwann Cells: Myelinate PNS axons
      and support neuronal regeneration.
    
    Potentials and Neurotransmitters
    
      An action potential is a rapid
      change in membrane potential that propagates along the axon of a neuron.
    
    
      A graded potential is a
      localized change in membrane potential that varies in magnitude and can
      lead to an action potential if it reaches the threshold.
    
    
      At resting potential, the inside of the neuron is more negative than the
      outside, primarily due to the distribution of ions across the membrane.
    
    
      
        Sodium exists in higher concentrations
        outside the neuron, while
        potassium is more concentrated
        inside.
      
      
        The
        sodium-potassium pump
        actively transports sodium out of the
        neuron and potassium in to the neuron,
        maintaining the concentration gradients.
      
    
    
      Depolarization occurs when sodium
      channels open, allowing sodium to enter the neuron, making the inside more
      positive.
    
    
      Repolarization occurs when
      potassium channels open, allowing potassium to exit the neuron, restoring
      the negative internal environment.
    
    
      Hyperpolarization occurs when
      potassium continues to exit the neuron, making the inside more negative
      than at rest.
    
    
      Neurotransmitters are chemical
      messengers that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to
      another.
    
    
      Amino acid neurotransmitters are
      involved in signal communication. They include glutamate (excitatory) and
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, inhibitory).
    
    
      Peptide neurotransmitters are chains of
      amino acids that can modulate neuronal activity. Examples include
      endorphins and opioids.
    
    
      Biogenic amines are small
      molecules derived from amino acids that function as neurotransmitters.
    
    
      
        Dopamine: Involved in reward,
        motivation, and motor control.
      
      
        Norepinephrine: Plays a role in
        attention and responding actions in the brain.
      
      
        Serotonin: Regulates mood, appetite,
        and sleep.
      
    
    
      Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter
      that plays a key role in muscle contraction and autonomic nervous system
      functions.
    
    Neurons
    Dendrites receive signals from other neurons.
    The cell body (soma) contains the nucleus and organelles.
    The axon transmits signals away from the cell body.
    Axon terminals release neurotransmitters into the synapse.
    
      Gray matter consists of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and unmyelinated
      axons.
    
    
      White matter consists of myelinated axons and is responsible for
      transmitting signals between different brain regions.
    
    Myelination increases the speed of signal transmission.
    Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in the myelin sheath that facilitate rapid signal conduction.
    Saltatory conduction is the process by which action potentials jump from one node of Ranvier to the next, increasing conduction velocity.
    Brain Regions
    
      The cerebrum</span

    Musculoskeletal System
    Muscle Types
    
      Skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movements.
      Cardiac muscle makes up the heart and is involuntary.
      Smooth muscle is found in hollow organs and is involuntary.
    
    Muscle cells
    Myocytes are the muscle cells responsible for contraction.
    
      Myofibrils are long, thread-like structures within myocytes that contain
      the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
    
    The sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of muscle fibers.
    
      Actin is a thin filament that interacts with myosin during muscle contraction.
      Myosin is a thick filament that interacts with actin to produce muscle contraction.
      The sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and releases them during muscle contraction.
      The sarcolemma is the plasma membrane of a muscle cell.
    Muscle Contraction
  Troponin is a protein that regulates muscle contraction by binding to calcium ions.
  Tropomyosin is a protein that blocks myosin-binding sites on actin filaments.
  Calcium ions bind to troponin, causing a conformational change.
  This change moves tropomyosin away from myosin-binding sites, allowing contraction to occur.
  Power Stroke
  Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges and pulling the filaments past each other.
  Then ATP binds to myosin, causing it to release actin and re-cock for another contraction.
  Hydrolysis of this molecule provides the energy for the power stroke.
  A force is generated as myosin pulls actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere.
  A new ATP molecule binds to myosin, allowing it to release actin.
  Myosin is now ready to bind to a new actin site and repeat the cycle.
    Ligaments and Joints
    Tendons connect muscles to bones.
    Ligaments connect bones to other bones at joints.
    
      Synovial joints are freely movable joints.
      Cartilaginous joints allow limited movement.

    The respiratory tract includes the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.
    
      The diaphragm is a muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the
      abdominal cavity and plays a key role in breathing.
    
    Gas Exchange
    Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, where oxygen is absorbed into the blood and carbon dioxide is released.
    Henry's law states that the amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure.
    Carbon dioxide exists in the body in three forms: dissolved in plasma, as bicarbonate ions, and bound to hemoglobin.

    Hormones bind to specific receptors on target cells to initiate a response.
    Primary messengers are hormones that bind to receptors on target cells to initiate a response.
    Secondary messengers are molecules that relay signals from primary messengers within the cell.
    Hormones can be classified as either hydrophilic (water-soluble) or hydrophobic (lipid-soluble).
    Hydrophilic hormones bind to receptors on the cell surface, while hydrophobic hormones pass through the cell membrane and bind to intracellular receptors.
    Endocrine Glands
    The hypothalamus is the master regulator of the endocrine system, controlling the release of hormones from the pituitary gland.
    The pituitary gland is divided into the anterior and posterior lobes, each secreting different hormones.
    The anterior pituitary produces hormones under the regulation of the hypothalamus.
    The posterior pituitary stores and releases hormones produced by the hypothalamus, including oxytocin and vasopressin.

        Dendritic cells
        are antigen-presenting cells that activate T cells by presenting antigens.
      
    
    Immune Response
    The innate immune response is the body's first line of defense against pathogens.
    The adaptive immune response is a specific response that develops over time and involves memory cells.
    The humoral immune response involves B cells and the production of antibodies.
    MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules are essential for the recognition of antigens by T cells.
    Reproductive System
    Male Reproductive System
    
      The testes produce sperm and hormones such as testosterone.
    
    
      The epididymis stores and matures sperm.
    
    
      The vas deferens transports sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct.
    
    
      The seminal vesicles produce a fluid that nourishes and helps transport sperm.
    
    
      The prostate gland produces a fluid that helps protect and activate sperm.
    
    The seminiferous tubules are the site of spermatogenesis within the testes.
    Female Reproductive System
    The ovaries produce eggs and hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.
    The fallopian tubes transport eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.
    The uterus is where a fertilized egg implants and develops during pregnancy.
    The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina.
      The follicular phase is characterized by the maturation of ovarian follicles and increased estrogen production.
      The ovulation phase is the release of a mature egg from the ovary, triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone.
      The luteal phase follows ovulation and involves the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone.
    Fertilization
    Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell successfully penetrates an egg cell.
    Cleavage is the series of rapid cell divisions that occur after fertilization. At its final stage, it forms a blastocyst.
    Implantation is the process by which the blastocyst attaches to the uterine wall.
    The blastocyst contains an inner cell mass that will develop into the embryo and an outer layer called the trophoblast that will form the placenta.
        The primitive streak marks the site of gastrulation, where the three germ layers begin to form.
The mesoderm is the middle germ layer that gives rise to muscles, bones, and the circulatory system.
    The endoderm is the innermost germ layer that forms the lining of the digestive and respiratory systems.
    The ectoderm is the outermost germ layer that develops into the skin and nervous system.
    During the embryo stage, the notochord forms and provides support for the developing nervous system.
    Neurulation is the process by which the neural tube forms, giving rise to the central nervous system.
    Renal System
    Kidneys
    First, unfiltered blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries.
    Within the kidneys, blood is filtered in the nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidney.
    
      The renal corpuscle is the initial filtering component of the nephron.
      The renal tubule is responsible for reabsorbing water and solutes from the filtrate.
      The loop of Henle is involved in concentrating urine by reabsorbing water and salts.
      The glomerulus is a network of capillaries that filters blood in the renal corpuscle.
      The Bowman’s capsule surrounds the glomerulus and collects the filtrate.
      Fenestrated capillaries in the glomerulus allow for the passage of small molecules while retaining larger ones.
      Podocytes are specialized cells in the Bowman’s capsule that wrap around the glomerulus and help filter blood.
    
        The renal pelvis collects urine from the nephrons and transports it to the ureters.
    The renal cortex is the outer layer of the kidney, containing the renal corpuscles and renal tubules.
    The renal medulla is the inner layer of the kidney, containing the loops of Henle and the collecting ducts.
    The ureters are tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder.
    The bladder is a muscular sac that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted.
    The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
    Nephron Function
    Filtration occurs in the glomerulus, where blood is filtered to form filtrate.
    Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubule, where water, ions, and nutrients are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream.
    Secretion occurs in the renal tubule, where waste products and excess ions are secreted into the filtrate.
    Excretion is the final step, where urine is formed and transported out of the body.

    Signal Transduction
    
      
        Signal transduction is the process by which a cell responds to external
        signals, leading to a cellular response.
      
    
    
      
        The binding of a ligand to its receptor initiates the signaling cascade.
      
      
        This can result in changes in gene expression, enzyme activity, or cell
        behavior.
        
          
            The first step is often the activation of a

            Receptor activation leads to a series of intracellular events, often
            involving second messengers like cAMP or calcium ions.
          
          
            These events can amplify the signal and lead to a specific cellular
            response.

    Bonding
    
    
    
      Chemical bonding describes how atoms are held together in molecules and compounds through various types of attractive forces.
      
      Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms to achieve stable electron configurations.
      
      Lewis structures are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms and lone pairs of electrons in molecules.
      
      Resonance occurs when a molecule can be represented by multiple valid Lewis structures that differ only in electron placement.
      
      Hybridization is the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals that can form stronger bonds.
      
      Sigma bonds form from the direct, head-on overlap of orbitals and allow free rotation around the bond axis.
      
      Pi bonds form from the side-by-side overlap of p orbitals and restrict rotation around the bond axis.
      
      Molecular geometry describes the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule based on electron pair positions.
      
      VSEPR theory predicts molecular geometry based on the repulsion between electron pairs around a central atom.
      
      Intermolecular forces are attractive forces that exist between separate molecules and affect physical properties.
      
      Hydrogen bonding is a strong intermolecular force that occurs when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative atoms like N, O, or F.
      
      Dipole-dipole forces are intermolecular attractions between the positive and negative ends of polar molecules.
      
      London dispersion forces are weak intermolecular forces caused by temporary dipoles in atoms and molecules.
      
      Van der Waals forces is a collective term for intermolecular forces including dipole-dipole and London dispersion forces.
