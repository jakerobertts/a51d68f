    1. What is the primary reason why digestive enzymes are specific to
    D-sugars?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="A"
      >Because of the chirality and 3D structure of the sugars.</span
    >
    <br />
    A. Because of the chirality and 3D structure of the sugars.
    <br />
    B. Because D-sugars are more abundant in nature.
    <br />
    C. Because D-sugars have a higher energy content.
    <br />
    D. Because D-sugars are more soluble in water.
    <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button">
      <span>Show Explanation</span>
    </button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        Digestive enzymes are specific to D-sugars primarily due to the
        chirality and 3D structure of the sugars. Chirality of D-sugars makes
        carbohydrates more available for enzymatic recognition. The active sites
        of these enzymes are designed to fit the specific shape of D-sugars,
        allowing for efficient catalysis of biochemical reactions.

        <br /><br />
        B. This is incorrect. While D-sugars are more common in nature, the
        specificity of enzymes is due to structural compatibility rather than
        abundance.
        <br />
        C. This is incorrect. The energy content of sugars does not determine
        enzyme specificity.
        <br />
        D. This is incorrect. Solubility in water does not influence the
        specificity of digestive enzymes.

    2. Which of the following would you expect in the breakdown of a
    disaccharide?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="D">Hydrolysis by a glycosidase.</span>
    <br />
    A. Oxidation by a glycosyltransferase.
    <br />
    B. Oxidation by a glycosidase.

    C. Hydrolysis by a glycosyltransferase.
    <br />

    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The breakdown of a disaccharide typically involves hydrolysis by a
        glycosidasE)Glycosidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of
        glycosidic bonds, which are the bonds that link monosaccharides together
        in disaccharides. This process involves the addition of a water molecule
        to break the bond, resulting in the formation of two monosaccharides.
        <br /><br />
        A. This is incorrect. Glycosyltransferases are involved in the synthesis
        of glycosidic bonds, not their breakdown.
        <br />
        B. This is incorrect. Oxidation is not the primary mechanism for
        breaking down disaccharides.
        <br />
        C. This is incorrect. Glycosyltransferases do not catalyze hydrolysis
        reactions.

    3. A student is asked to explain the structural difference of fructose from
    glucose, galactose, and mannosE)The student states:<br /><br />
    I. Fructose is a ketose, while the others are aldoses.<br />
    II. Fructose has 8 stereoisomers, while the others have 16.<br />
    III. Fructose contains 5 carbon atoms, while the others contain 6.<br />
    <br /><br />
    Which of the following is incorrect?<br />
    <span data-quiz="C">A. III only</span><br />
    A. II only<br />
    B. II and III only<br />
    C. III only<br />
    D. I, II, and III<br />
    <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The incorrect statement is III only. Fructose, like glucose, galactose,
        and mannose, contains 6 carbon atoms. Fructose has a 5-membered ring.
        However, it is a ketohexose, which implies it has six carbon atoms and a
        ketone functional group. The other three sugars are aldohexoses, meaning
        they also have six carbon atoms but contain an aldehyde functional
        group. There are 4 chiral centers in aldohexoses. We multiply 2<sup
          >n</sup
        >
        to get the number of stereoisomers, where n is the number of chiral
        centers. Therefore, 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 stereoisomers for glucose,
        galactose, and mannosE)Fructose has 3 chiral centers, leading to 2<sup
          >3</sup

        = 8 stereoisomers.

    4. Which step of glycolysis is irreversible and is the first step of
    intracellular metabolism?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="B"
      >Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase.</span
    >
    <br />
    A. Conversion of Fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by
    phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1).<br />
    B. Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase.<br />
    C. Conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by
    glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.<br />
    D. Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by pyruvate
    kinase.<br />
    <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is B. Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by
        hexokinasE)This step is irreversible and involves the consumption of one
        ATP moleculE)Hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, which
        is a key regulatory step in glycolysis. The addition of the phosphate
        group effectively traps glucose within the cell and prepares it for
        further metabolism.
        <br /><br />
        A. This step is also irreversible and is a major regulatory point in
        glycolysis, but it does not ensure intracellular metabolism.
        <br />
        C. This step is reversible and does not involve ATP consumption, but
        rather the production of NADH. <br />
        D. This step is irreversible and generates ATP inside the cell.

    5. During anaerobic glyolysis (fermentation), pyruvate is converted to
    lactate in order to:
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="C">Regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis to continue.</span>
    <br />
    A. Produce additional ATP molecules.
    <br />
    B. Generate acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle.
    <br />
    C. Regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis to continue.
    <br />
    D. Facilitate the transport of pyruvate into the mitochondria.
    <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is C. Regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis to continue.
        During anaerobic glycolysis, the conversion of pyruvate to lactate is
        catalyzed by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenasE)This reaction oxidizes
        NADH back to NAD⁺, which is essential for the continuation of
        glycolysis. Since glycolysis requires NAD⁺ to accept electrons during
        the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, regenerating NAD⁺ allows
        glycolysis to proceed and produce ATP even in the absence of oxygen.
        <br /><br />
        A. This is incorrect. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate does not
        produce additional ATP; ATP is generated during earlier steps of
        glycolysis.
        <br />
        B. This is incorrect. The generation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate occurs
        under aerobic conditions, not during anaerobic glycolysis.
        <br />
        D. This is incorrect. The transport of pyruvate into the mitochondria is
        not facilitated by its conversion to lactate; rather, pyruvate is
        transported directly into the mitochondria under aerobic conditions.

    6. The deficiency of phosphorylase kinase would most likely result in:
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="A">Conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.</span>
    <br />
    A. Conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.
    <br />
    B. Conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate.
    <br />
    C. Conversion of glycogen to glucose-6-phosphate.
    <br />D. Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucosE)<br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is A. Conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.
        Phosphorylase kinase is an enzyme that activates glycogen phosphorylase,
        which is responsible for breaking down glycogen into
        glucose-1-phosphatE)A deficiency in phosphorylase kinase would impair
        the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, leading to a reduced ability
        to convert glycogen into glucose-1-phosphatE)This would result in an
        accumulation of glycogen and a decrease in the availability of
        glucose-1-phosphate for further metabolism.
        <br /><br />
        B. This is incorrect. The conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to
        glucose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase, which
        is not directly affected by phosphorylase kinase deficiency.
        <br />
        C. This is incorrect. Glycogen is first converted to glucose-1-phosphate
        before it can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate.
        <br />
        D. This is incorrect. The conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose
        is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase, which is not directly affected by
        phosphorylase kinase deficiency.

    7. A disease is identified by the deficiency of of NADPH. Which process is
    most likely affected, and which metabolic pathways are most likely to be
    impaired?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="B"
      >The pentose phosphate pathway; fatty acid synthesis.</span
    >
    <br />
    A. Glycolysis; ATP production.
    <br />B. The pentose phosphate pathway; fatty acid synthesis. <br />C. The
    pentose phosphate pathway; nucleotide synthesis. <br />D. Glycolysis;
    nucleotide synthesis. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is B. The pentose phosphate pathway; fatty acid
        synthesis. The pentose phosphate pathway is a metabolic pathway parallel
        to glycolysis that generates NADPH and ribose-5-phosphatE)NADPH is
        crucial for fatty acid synthesis, as it provides the reducing power
        needed for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. A deficiency in NADPH would
        impair the ability of cells to carry out fatty acid synthesis
        effectively.
        <br /><br />
        A. This is incorrect. Glycolysis primarily produces ATP and NADH, not
        NADPH.
        <br />
        C. This is incorrect. While the pentose phosphate pathway produces a
        precursor to nucleotide synthesis, ribose-5-phosphate is this precursor,
        not NADPH. Nucleotide synthesis is not directly dependent on NADPH.
        <br />
        D. This is incorrect. Glycolysis does not produce NADPH, and nucleotide
        synthesis is not directly dependent on NADPH.

    8. Which metabolic process is not likely to involve the direct use or
    production of carbohydrate derivatives?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="D">Beta-oxidation of fatty acids.</span>
    <br />
    A. Glycolysis.
    <br />
    B. Gluconeogenesis. <br />
    C. The pentose phosphate pathway. <br />
    D. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is D. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Beta-oxidation
        is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in the
        mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric
        acid cyclE)This process does not directly involve the use of
        carbohydrates. Instead, it primarily utilizes fatty acids as the
        substrate for energy production.
        <br /><br />
        A. This is incorrect. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts
        glucose into pyruvate, directly involving carbohydrate derivatives.
        <br />
        B. This is incorrect. Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing
        glucose and involves carbohydrate derivatives. <br />
        C. This is incorrect. The pentose phosphate pathway generates NADPH and
        ribose-5-phosphate, a carbohydrate derivative.

    9. Which of the following molecules is both an allosteric activator and an
    allosteric inhibitor of glycogen metabolism?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="C">Glucose-6-phosphate.</span>
    <br />
    A. ATP.
    <br />
    B. AMP. <br />
    C. Glucose-6-phosphatE)<br />
    D. GlucosE)<br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is C. Glucose-6-phosphatE)Glucose-6-phosphate acts as
        an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, promoting glycogen
        synthesis when glucose levels are high. Conversely, it serves as an
        allosteric inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase, reducing glycogen
        breakdown when glucose is abundant. This dual role helps regulate
        glycogen metabolism based on the cellular energy state and glucose
        availability.
        <br /><br />
        A. This is incorrect. ATP is an allosteric inhibitor of glycogen
        phosphorylase but does not act as an activator.
        <br />
        B. This is incorrect. AMP is an allosteric activator of glycogen
        phosphorylase but does not act as an inhibitor. <br />
        D. This is incorrect. Glucose does not have a direct allosteric effect
        on glycogen metabolism.

    10. Which hormone promotes the storage of glucose?
    <span data-quiz="A">Insulin.</span>
    <br />
    A. Insulin.
    <br />
    B. Glucagon. <br />
    C. EpinephrinE)<br />
    D. Cortisol. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is A. Insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the
        pancreas that promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in cells. It
        facilitates the conversion of glucose into glycogen in the liver and
        muscle tissues, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Insulin also
        stimulates the synthesis of fatty acids and inhibits gluconeogenesis,
        further promoting glucose storage.
        <br /><br />
        B. This is incorrect. Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose
        levels by promoting glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis.
        <br />
        C. This is incorrect. Epinephrine (adrenalinE)increases blood glucose
        levels by stimulating glycogen breakdown and inhibiting insulin
        secretion. <br />
        D. This is incorrect. Cortisol is a stress hormone that increases blood
        glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glucose
        uptake in tissues.
