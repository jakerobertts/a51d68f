    1. What is the primary reason why digestive enzymes are specific to
    D-sugars?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="A"
      >Because of the chirality and 3D structure of the sugars.</span
    >
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Because of the chirality and 3D structure of the sugars.
    <br />
    <strong>B.</strong> Because D-sugars are more abundant in nature.
    <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> Because D-sugars have a higher energy content.
    <br />
    <strong>D.</strong> Because D-sugars are more soluble in water. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button">
      <span>Show Explanation</span>
    </button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        Digestive enzymes are specific to D-sugars primarily due to the
        chirality and 3D structure of the sugars. Chirality of D-sugars makes
        carbohydrates more available for enzymatic recognition. The active sites
        of these enzymes are designed to fit the specific shape of D-sugars,
        allowing for efficient catalysis of biochemical reactions.

        <br /><br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. While D-sugars are more common in
        nature, the specificity of enzymes is due to structural compatibility
        rather than abundance.
        <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This is incorrect. The energy content of sugars does
        not determine enzyme specificity.
        <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This is incorrect. Solubility in water does not
        influence the specificity of digestive enzymes.

    2. Which of the following would you expect in the breakdown of a
    disaccharide?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="D">Hydrolysis by a glycosidase.</span>
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Oxidation by a glycosyltransferase.
    <br />
    <strong>B.</strong> Oxidation by a glycosidase.
    <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> Hydrolysis by a glycosyltransferase.
    <br />
    <strong>D.</strong> Hydrolysis by a glycosidase. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The breakdown of a disaccharide typically involves hydrolysis by a
        glycosidasE)Glycosidases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of
        glycosidic bonds, which are the bonds that link monosaccharides together
        in disaccharides. This process involves the addition of a water molecule
        to break the bond, resulting in the formation of two monosaccharides.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>A.</strong> This is incorrect. Glycosyltransferases are involved
        in the synthesis of glycosidic bonds, not their breakdown.
        <br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. Oxidation is not the primary
        mechanism for breaking down disaccharides.
        <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This is incorrect. Glycosyltransferases do not
        catalyze hydrolysis reactions.

    3. A student is asked to explain the structural difference of fructose from
    glucose, galactose, and mannosE)The student states:<br /><br />
    I. Fructose is a ketose, while the others are aldoses.<br />
    II. Fructose has 8 stereoisomers, while the others have 16.<br />
    III. Fructose contains 5 carbon atoms, while the others contain 6.<br />
    <br /><br />
    Which of the following is incorrect?<br />
    <span data-quiz="C"><strong>A.</strong> III only</span><br />
    <strong>A.</strong> II only<br />
    <strong>B.</strong> II and III only<br />
    <strong>C.</strong> III only<br />
    <strong>D.</strong> I, II, and III<br />
    <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The incorrect statement is III only. Fructose, like glucose, galactose,
        and mannose, contains 6 carbon atoms. Fructose has a 5-membered ring.
        However, it is a ketohexose, which implies it has six carbon atoms and a
        ketone functional group. The other three sugars are aldohexoses, meaning
        they also have six carbon atoms but contain an aldehyde functional
        group. There are 4 chiral centers in aldohexoses. We multiply 2<sup
          >n</sup
        >
        to get the number of stereoisomers, where n is the number of chiral
        centers. Therefore, 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 stereoisomers for glucose,
        galactose, and mannosE)Fructose has 3 chiral centers, leading to 2<sup
          >3</sup

        = 8 stereoisomers.

    4. Which step of glycolysis is irreversible and is the first step of
    intracellular metabolism?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="B"
      >Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase.</span
    >
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Conversion of Fructose-6-phosphate to
    fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1).<br />
    <strong>B.</strong> Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by
    hexokinase.<br />
    <strong>C.</strong> Conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to
    1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.<br />
    <strong>D.</strong> Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by
    pyruvate kinase.<br />
    <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is <strong>B.</strong> Conversion of glucose to
        glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinasE)This step is irreversible and involves
        the consumption of one ATP moleculE)Hexokinase catalyzes the
        phosphorylation of glucose, which is a key regulatory step in
        glycolysis. The addition of the phosphate group effectively traps
        glucose within the cell and prepares it for further metabolism.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>A.</strong> This step is also irreversible and is a major
        regulatory point in glycolysis, but it does not ensure intracellular
        metabolism.
        <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This step is reversible and does not involve ATP
        consumption, but rather the production of NADH. <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This step is irreversible and generates ATP inside
        the cell.

    5. During anaerobic glyolysis (fermentation), pyruvate is converted to
    lactate in order to:
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="C">Regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis to continue.</span>
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Produce additional ATP molecules.
    <br />
    <strong>B.</strong> Generate acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle.
    <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> Regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis to continue.
    <br />
    <strong>D.</strong> Facilitate the transport of pyruvate into the
    mitochondria. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is <strong>C.</strong> Regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis
        to continue. During anaerobic glycolysis, the conversion of pyruvate to
        lactate is catalyzed by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenasE)This reaction
        oxidizes NADH back to NAD⁺, which is essential for the continuation of
        glycolysis. Since glycolysis requires NAD⁺ to accept electrons during
        the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, regenerating NAD⁺ allows
        glycolysis to proceed and produce ATP even in the absence of oxygen.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>A.</strong> This is incorrect. The conversion of pyruvate to
        lactate does not produce additional ATP; ATP is generated during earlier
        steps of glycolysis.
        <br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. The generation of acetyl-CoA from
        pyruvate occurs under aerobic conditions, not during anaerobic
        glycolysis.
        <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This is incorrect. The transport of pyruvate into
        the mitochondria is not facilitated by its conversion to lactate;
        rather, pyruvate is transported directly into the mitochondria under
        aerobic conditions.

    6. The deficiency of phosphorylase kinase would most likely result in:
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="A">Conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.</span>
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.
    <br />

    glucose-6-phosphate.
    <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> Conversion of glycogen to glucose-6-phosphate. <br />D.
    Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucosE)<br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is <strong>A.</strong> Conversion of glycogen to
        glucose-1-phosphate. Phosphorylase kinase is an enzyme that activates
        glycogen phosphorylase, which is responsible for breaking down glycogen
        into glucose-1-phosphatE)A deficiency in phosphorylase kinase would
        impair the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, leading to a reduced
        ability to convert glycogen into glucose-1-phosphatE)This would result
        in an accumulation of glycogen and a decrease in the availability of
        glucose-1-phosphate for further metabolism. <br /><br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. The conversion of
        glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by the enzyme
        phosphoglucomutase, which is not directly affected by phosphorylase
        kinase deficiency.
        <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This is incorrect. Glycogen is first converted to
        glucose-1-phosphate before it can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate.
        <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This is incorrect. The conversion of
        glucose-6-phosphate to glucose is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase,
        which is not directly affected by phosphorylase kinase deficiency.

    7. A disease is identified by the deficiency of of NADPH. Which process is
    most likely affected, and which metabolic pathways are most likely to be
    impaired?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="B"
      >The pentose phosphate pathway; fatty acid synthesis.</span
    >
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Glycolysis; ATP production. <br /><strong>B.</strong>
    The pentose phosphate pathway; fatty acid synthesis. <br /><strong
      >C.</strong
    >
    The pentose phosphate pathway; nucleotide synthesis. <br /><strong

    Glycolysis; nucleotide synthesis. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is <strong>B.</strong> The pentose phosphate pathway;
        fatty acid synthesis. The pentose phosphate pathway is a metabolic
        pathway parallel to glycolysis that generates NADPH and
        ribose-5-phosphatE)NADPH is crucial for fatty acid synthesis, as it
        provides the reducing power needed for the biosynthesis of fatty acids.
        A deficiency in NADPH would impair the ability of cells to carry out
        fatty acid synthesis effectively. <br /><br />
        <strong>A.</strong> This is incorrect. Glycolysis primarily produces ATP
        and NADH, not NADPH.
        <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This is incorrect. While the pentose phosphate
        pathway produces a precursor to nucleotide synthesis, ribose-5-phosphate
        is this precursor, not NADPH. Nucleotide synthesis is not directly
        dependent on NADPH.
        <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This is incorrect. Glycolysis does not produce
        NADPH, and nucleotide synthesis is not directly dependent on NADPH.

    8. Which metabolic process is not likely to involve the direct use or
    production of carbohydrate derivatives?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="D">Beta-oxidation of fatty acids.</span>
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Glycolysis.
    <br />
    <strong>B.</strong> Gluconeogenesis. <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> The pentose phosphate pathway. <br />
    <strong>D.</strong> Beta-oxidation of fatty acids. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is <strong>D.</strong> Beta-oxidation of fatty acids.
        Beta-oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken
        down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, which can then enter
        the citric acid cyclE)This process does not directly involve the use of
        carbohydrates. Instead, it primarily utilizes fatty acids as the
        substrate for energy production. <br /><br />
        <strong>A.</strong> This is incorrect. Glycolysis is the metabolic
        pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, directly involving
        carbohydrate derivatives.
        <br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. Gluconeogenesis is the process of
        synthesizing glucose and involves carbohydrate derivatives. <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This is incorrect. The pentose phosphate pathway
        generates NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, a carbohydrate derivative.

    9. Which of the following molecules is both an allosteric activator and an
    allosteric inhibitor of glycogen metabolism?
    <br />
    <span data-quiz="C">Glucose-6-phosphate.</span>
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> ATP.
    <br />
    <strong>B.</strong> AMP. <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> Glucose-6-phosphatE)<br />
    <strong>D.</strong> GlucosE)<br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is
        <strong>C.</strong> Glucose-6-phosphatE)Glucose-6-phosphate acts as an
        allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, promoting glycogen synthesis
        when glucose levels are high. Conversely, it serves as an allosteric
        inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase, reducing glycogen breakdown when
        glucose is abundant. This dual role helps regulate glycogen metabolism
        based on the cellular energy state and glucose availability.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>A.</strong> This is incorrect. ATP is an allosteric inhibitor of
        glycogen phosphorylase but does not act as an activator.
        <br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. AMP is an allosteric activator of
        glycogen phosphorylase but does not act as an inhibitor. <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This is incorrect. Glucose does not have a direct
        allosteric effect on glycogen metabolism.

    10. Which hormone promotes the storage of glucose?
    <span data-quiz="A">Insulin.</span>
    <br />
    <strong>A.</strong> Insulin.
    <br />
    <strong>B.</strong> Glucagon. <br />
    <strong>C.</strong> EpinephrinE)<br />
    <strong>D.</strong> Cortisol. <br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The correct answer is <strong>A.</strong> Insulin. Insulin is a hormone
        produced by the pancreas that promotes the uptake and storage of glucose
        in cells. It facilitates the conversion of glucose into glycogen in the
        liver and muscle tissues, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Insulin
        also stimulates the synthesis of fatty acids and inhibits
        gluconeogenesis, further promoting glucose storage. <br /><br />
        <strong>B.</strong> This is incorrect. Glucagon is a hormone that raises
        blood glucose levels by promoting glycogen breakdown and
        gluconeogenesis.
        <br />
        <strong>C.</strong> This is incorrect. Epinephrine (adrenalinE)increases
        blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogen breakdown and inhibiting
        insulin secretion. <br />
        <strong>D.</strong> This is incorrect. Cortisol is a stress hormone that
        increases blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and
        inhibiting glucose uptake in tissues.
