    <h1>Fats</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. They are a source of energy and help your body absorb <span data-quiz="vitamins" data-hint="Essential nutrients (A, D, E, K)">vitamins</span>.</li>
      <li>Digestion, mobilization, and transport of fats occur in the mouth/stomach, <span data-quiz="small intestine" data-hint="Main site of fat digestion">small intestine</span>, adipocytes, and blood.</li>
      <li>Digestion begins in the mouth/stomach with lingual and gastric <span data-quiz="lipases" data-hint="Which enzymes?">lipases</span>, mainly occurring in the small intestine with pancreatic lipases aided by <span data-quiz="bile salts" data-hint="Emulsification agents from liver">bile salts</span>.</li>
      <li>Products from digestion form <span data-quiz="micelles" data-hint="Lipid transport structures">micelles</span>, which diffuse into enterocytes, re-esterify into triglycerides, and finally pack into <span data-quiz="chylomicrons" data-hint="Dietary fat transport particles">chylomicrons</span>, and enter lymphatic blood.</li>
      <li><span data-quiz="Lipase" data-hint="Enzyme that breaks down fats">Lipase</span> in adipocytes activates by glucagon/epinephrine, liberating fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids bind <span data-quiz="albumin" data-hint="Blood protein carrier">albumin</span> for transport.</li>
      <li><span data-quiz="chylomicrons" data-hint="Dietary fat carriers">Chylomicrons</span> are molecules that carry dietary fats, <span data-quiz="VLDL" data-hint="Very Low Density Lipoprotein">VLDL</span> transports endogenously made triglycerides, and LDL/HDLs handle cholesterol. Free fatty acids circulate bound to albumin.</li>
      <li>Oxidation of fatty acids occurs in <span data-quiz="mitochondria" data-hint="Cellular powerhouses">mitochondria</span> (and peroxisomes/ER for special cases), breaking down fatty acids into <span data-quiz="acetyl-CoA" data-hint="Which molecule?">acetyl-CoA</span>, NADH, and FADH₂.</li>
        <li>Fatty acids break down into <span data-quiz="acyl-CoA" data-hint="Activated fatty acid form">acyl-CoA</span> via synthetase</li>
        <li>Long-chain fatty acids use the <span data-quiz="carnitine" data-hint="Which transport system?">carnitine</span> shuttle to enter mitochondria</li>
      <li>Each cycle releases NADH, FADH₂, and acetyl-CoA, entering the <span data-quiz="TCA cycle" data-hint="Krebs cycle">TCA cycle</span> and yielding ~<span data-quiz="120" data-hint="ATP count from C18 fatty acid">120</span> ATP from stearate (C18).</li>
      <li>Unsaturated & odd/very-long chains require auxiliary enzymes and <span data-quiz="peroxisomal" data-hint="Organelle for special processing">peroxisomal</span> processing. They contribute to the fluidity of the cell-membrane</li>
      <li>Saturated fatty acids are primarily metabolized in the mitochondria via β-oxidation. They are beneficial to the cell membrane in low temperatures.</li>
      <li>Lipogenesis is stimulated by the hormone <span data-quiz="insulin" data-hint="Hormone promoting fat storage">insulin</span> and inhibited by <span data-quiz="glucagon" data-hint="Counter-regulatory hormone">glucagon</span>.</li>
      <li>Lipids are synthesized in the cell's <span data-quiz="cytoplasm" data-hint="Where does lipogenesis occur?">cytoplasm</span>.</li>
      <li>Fatty acid synthesis involves <span data-quiz="acetyl-CoA" data-hint="Starting molecule for synthesis">acetyl-CoA</span>, <span data-quiz="malonyl-CoA" data-hint="Intermediate in fatty acid synthesis">malonyl-CoA</span>, and <span data-quiz="NADPH" data-hint="Reducing agent in synthesis">NADPH</span>.</li>
       <p><strong>Dive deeper:</strong> Lipids are emulsified in the small intestine by <span data-quiz="bile salts">bile salts</span>, which are produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Chylomicrons are assembled in cells called <span data-quiz="enterocytes">enterocytes</span>, which are transported via the <span data-quiz="lymphatic" data-hint="Lipid transport system">lymphatic</span> system before entering the bloodstream. VLDL is produced in the liver and transports endogenous <span data-quiz="triglycerides">triglycerides</span> to peripheral tissues. LDL is responsible for delivering <span data-quiz="cholesterol">cholesterol</span> to cells, while HDL helps remove excess cholesterol from cells and transport it back to the <span data-quiz="liver">liver</span> for excretion. The production of ketone bodies is important for organs during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake. </p>
