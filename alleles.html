    <h1>Alleles & Genes</h1>
    <li>
      A
      <span data-quiz="gene">gene</span>
      is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or functional RNA.
    </li>
    <li>
      An
      <span data-quiz="allele">allele</span>
      is a variant form of a gene that can result in different traits or
      phenotypes.
    </li>
    <li>
      For every gene in each human, there are
      <span data-quiz="two">two</span> alleles, leading to genetic variation
      within a population.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alleles can be dominant or recessive.A
      <span data-quiz="dominant">dominant</span>
      allele masks the effect of a recessive allele when both are present in an
      individual.
    </li>
    <li>
      An individual with two identical alleles for a trait is said to be
      <span data-quiz="homozygous">homozygous</span>, while an individual with
      two different alleles is
      <span data-quiz="heterozygous">heterozygous</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <span data-quiz="genotype">genotype</span> is the genetic makeup of an
      individual, while a <span data-quiz="phenotype">phenotype</span> is the
      observable expression of that genotype.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <span data-quiz="wild-type">wild-type</span> allele is the most common
      form of a gene in a population, while mutant alleles are less common and
      can arise from mutations.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <span data-quiz="locus">locus</span> is the specific location of a gene
      on a chromosome, and alleles at a locus can vary in sequence, leading to
      different traits.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alleles can undergo
      <span
        data-quiz="incomplete dominance"
        data-hint="The phenotype is a blend of both alleles."
        >incomplete dominance</span
      >
      or
      <span
        data-quiz="codominance"
        data-hint="Both alleles are fully expressed."
        >codominance</span
      >, where both alleles contribute to the phenotype in different ways.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Leakage">Leakage</span> is the transfer of alleles
      between species, which can occur through hybridization or horizontal gene
      transfer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Penetrance">Penetrance</span> refers to the proportion of
      individuals with a specific genotype that express the expected phenotype,
      while <span data-quiz="Expressivity">expressivity</span> refers to the
      degree to which a genotype is expressed in an individual.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Genetic Drift">Genetic Drift</span> is the change in
      allele frequencies in a population due to random sampling events, which
      can lead to the loss of genetic variation over time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Founder Effect">Founder Effect</span> occurs when a small
      group of individuals establishes a new population, leading to reduced
      genetic variation compared to the original population.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="Gene pool">Gene pool</span> refers to the total
      collection of alleles in a population, which can change over time due to
      factors like natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift.
    </li>
    <p>
      A generation of 1:1 ratio of blue to red flowers would demonstrate
      <span data-quiz="codominance">codominance</span>. A homozygous red and
      homozygous white flower produce pink flowers, which would demonstrate
      <span data-quiz="incomplete dominance">incomplete dominance</span>.
      Individuals with the same allele for skin color may exhibit different
      shades due to environmental factors, which demonstrates
      <span data-quiz="expressivity">expressivity</span>. Some may not display a
      shade at all, regardless of the allele, representing
      <span data-quiz="penetrance">penetrance</span>.

    <h1>Practice Questions</h1>
    Which of the following describes the relationship between alleles and
    genes? Type the letter of the answer: <span data-quiz="A">A</span>
    <br><br>
    <strong>A.</strong>  Alleles are different forms of a gene that can result in different traits.<br />
    <strong>B.</strong>   Alleles are the same as genes and do not vary in sequence.<br />
    <strong>C.</strong>   Alleles are only found in dominant forms.<br />
    <strong>D.</strong>   Alleles are only found in recessive forms.<br />

    <br><br>
    What is the primary difference between expressivity and penetrance? Type the letter of the answer: <span data-quiz="A">A</span>

    <br><br>
    <strong>A.</strong>  Expressivity refers to the degree of expression of a genotype, while penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals with a specific genotype that express the expected phenotype.<br />
    <strong>B.</strong>   Expressivity refers to the proportion of individuals with a specific genotype that express the expected phenotype, while penetrance refers to the degree of expression of a genotype.<br />
    <strong>C.</strong>   Expressivity is related to dominant alleles, while penetrance is related to recessive alleles.<br />
    <strong>D.</strong>   Expressivity is related to recessive alleles, while penetrance is related to dominant alleles.<br />
