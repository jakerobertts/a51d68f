      <strong>Dive deeper:</strong>
      The atomic structure is fundamental to understanding chemical bonding,
      periodic trends, and the behavior of elements in reactions. Z_eff is how
      strongly the <span data-quiz="nucleus">nucleus</span> attracts electrons,
      and it increases across a
      <span data-quiz="period" data-hint="Horizontal row in the periodic table"
        >period</span
      >
      in the periodic table due to increased nuclear charge and decreased
      shielding. Half-filled and fully filled subshells are more stable due to
      electron-electron <span data-quiz="repulsion">repulsion</span> being
      minimized, leading to lower energy states. The photoelectric effect
      supports the particle nature of light, showing that light can behave as
      both a wave and a particle.<span data-quiz="alkali">Alkali</span> metals
      are highly reactive due to their single valence electron, while noble
      gases are inert due to their complete valence shells. Transition metals
      can form various oxidation states and colored compounds due to their
      <span data-quiz="d ">d</span> orbitals. Ionization energy, electron
      affinity, and electronegativity are key concepts in understanding chemical
      reactivity and bonding. Atomic size decreases across a
      <span data-quiz="period">period</span> due to increased nuclear
      <span data-quiz="charge">charge</span> pulling electrons closer, while
      ionic size varies based on the charge of the ion, with cations being
      smaller and anions larger than their neutral counterparts.
