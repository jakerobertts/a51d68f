        <span data-quiz="Cofactors" data-hint="Inorganic ions like Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Zn²⁺">Cofactors</span>
        are typically inorganic ions such as magnesium (Mg²⁺), iron (Fe²⁺), or zinc (Zn²⁺). They bind to the enzyme and are essential for its activity.
      </li>
      <li>      
        <span data-quiz="Coenzymes" data-hint="Organic molecules like vitamins">Coenzymes</span>
        are organic molecules, often derived from vitamins, that assist in enzyme function. They can be tightly or loosely bound to the enzyme and are often involved in transferring chemical groups during reactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins (e.g., B1, B2, B3, B6, B12) and vitamin C often serve as coenzymes. They participate in various enzymatic reactions, aiding in processes such as energy production and the synthesis of <span data-quiz="macromolecules" data-hint="Large biological molecules">macromolecules</span>.
