    <h2>1°, 2°, 3°, and 4° structure of proteins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1° structure linkage is the
        <span data-quiz="peptide" data-hint="Linkage between amino acids"
          >peptide</span
        >
        bond between amino acids
      </li>
      <li>
        2° structure is the local folding of the polypeptide chain into
        <span data-quiz="alpha" data-hint="Common secondary structure"
          >alpha</span
        >
        helices and

          >beta</span
        >
        sheets, stabilized by
        <span data-quiz="hydrogen" data-hint="Common stabilizing interactions"
          >hydrogen</span
        >
        bonds.
      </li>
      <li>
        3° structure is the overall 3D shape of a protein, determined by
        interactions between R groups, including hydrophobic interactions,
        hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and
        <span
          data-quiz="disulfide"
          data-hint="Covalent bond between cysteine residues"
          >disulfide</span
        >
        bridges.
      </li>
      <li>
        4° structure is the assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits into a
        functional protein complex, stabilized by the same interactions as 3°
        structure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Amino Acid Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="nonpolar"
          data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains"
          >Nonpolar</span
        >
        amino acids have hydrophobic side chains that do not interact favorably
        with water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="polar"
          data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophilic side chains"
          >Polar</span
        >
        amino acids have side chains that can form hydrogen bonds with water,
        making them hydrophilic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          data-quiz="charged"
          data-hint="Amino acids with charged side chains"
          >Charged</span
        >
        amino acids have side chains that can gain or lose protons, resulting in
        positive or negative charges at physiological pH.
      </li>
    </ul>

      The primary structure dictates all higher-order structures. Alpha helices
      have a <span data-quiz="right">right</span>-handed twist and are
      stabilized by hydrogen bonds every <span data-quiz="4">4</span> residues,
      while <span data-quiz="beta">beta</span> sheets can be parallel or
      antiparallel, with hydrogen bonds between strands. In a tertiary
      structure, <span data-quiz="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</span> interactions
      drive folding, where nonpolar residues cluster inside the protein, away
      from the aqueous environment. The quaternary structure involves multiple
      polypeptide chains, which can be identical or different, forming a
      functional protein complex. <br />

    <h2>Protein Structure and Function</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Protein folding is driven by the

          data-hint="Tendency of nonpolar side chains to avoid water"
          >hydrophobic</span

        effect, where nonpolar side chains cluster away from water, and polar
        side chains interact with the aqueous environment

        bonds, which are covalent linkages that

        protein structure.

        introduces kinks in the polypeptide chain, affecting overall folding
      </li>
      <li>
        Conformational stability of proteins is influenced by factors such as
        <span data-quiz="pH">pH</span>
        and temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="denaturation">Denaturation</span> is the loss of
        protein structure and function due to factors like heat, pH changes, or
        chemical agents
      </li>
      <li>
        Hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in protein
        <span data-quiz="folding">folding</span>
        and stability, as nonpolar side chains tend to avoid contact with water,
        driving the folding process.

    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Nonpolar residues cluster in the protein
      core due to the hydrophobic effect, making it the primary driving force of
      protein folding. Since cysteine can form disulfide bonds, a
      <span data-quiz="reducing">reducing</span> agent can break these bonds.
      Since proline introduces kinks, it is often found at the beginning of
      <span data-quiz="alpha">alpha</span> helices or in turns. While
      <span data-quiz="methionine">methionine</span> is sulfur-containing, its
      chemical structure does not allow for the formation of disulfide bridges.
      Changes in <span data-quiz="pH">pH</span> disrupt non-covalent
      interactions like hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds, affecting
      <span data-quiz="secondary">secondary</span>, tertiary, and quaternary
      structures. Primary structure, held by covalent peptide bonds, is
      generally unaffected by
