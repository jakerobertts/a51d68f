    <h1>Amino Acids</h1>
    <h2>1°, 2°, 3°, and 4° structure of proteins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1° structure linkage is the
        <span data-quiz="peptide" data-hint="Linkage between amino acids"
          >peptide</span
        >
        bond between amino acids
      </li>
      <li>2° structure is the local folding of the polypeptide chain into
      <span data-quiz="alpha" data-hint="Common secondary structure"
        >alpha</span
      >
      helices and
      <span data-quiz="beta" data-hint="Common secondary structure"
        >beta</span
      >
      sheets, stabilized by
      <span data-quiz="hydrogen" data-hint="Common stabilizing interactions"
        >hydrogen</span
      >
      bonds.
    </li>
    <li>
      3° structure is the overall 3D shape of a protein, determined by
      interactions between R groups, including hydrophobic interactions,
      hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and
      <span
        data-quiz="disulfide"
        data-hint="Covalent bond between cysteine residues"
        >disulfide</span
      >
      bridges.
    </li>
    <li>
      4° structure is the assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits into a
      functional protein complex, stabilized by the same interactions as 3°
      structure.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Amino Acid Properties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="nonpolar"
        data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains"
        >Nonpolar</span
      >
      amino acids have hydrophobic side chains that do not interact favorably
      with water.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="polar"
        data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophilic side chains"
        >Polar</span
      >
      amino acids have side chains that can form hydrogen bonds with water,
      making them hydrophilic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="charged"
        data-hint="Amino acids with charged side chains"
        >Charged</span
      >
      amino acids have side chains that can gain or lose protons, resulting in
      positive or negative charges at physiological pH.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Protein Structure and Function</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Protein folding is driven by the
      <span
        data-quiz="hydrophobic"
        data-hint="Tendency of nonpolar side chains to avoid water"
        >hydrophobic</span
      >
      effect, where nonpolar side chains cluster away from water, and polar
      side chains interact with the aqueous environment
    </li>
    <li>
      Cysteine can form
      <span
        data-quiz="disulfide"
        data-hint="Covalent bond between cysteine residues"
        >disulfide</span
      >
      bonds, which are covalent linkages that
      <span data-quiz="stabilize">stabilize</span>
      protein structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="proline"
        data-hint="Amino acid that introduces kinks in the polypeptide chain"
        >Proline</span
      >
      introduces kinks in the polypeptide chain, affecting overall folding
    </li>
    <li>
      Conformational stability of proteins is influenced by factors such as
      <span data-quiz="pH">pH</span>
      and temperature.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span data-quiz="denaturation">Denaturation</span> is the loss of
      protein structure and function due to factors like heat, pH changes, or
      chemical agents
    </li>
    <li>
      Hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in protein
      <span data-quiz="folding">folding</span>
      and stability, as nonpolar side chains tend to avoid contact with water,
      driving the folding process.
