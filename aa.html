            data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophobic side chains"
            >Nonpolar</span
          >
          amino acids have hydrophobic side chains that do not interact
          favorably with water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="polar"
            data-hint="Amino acids with hydrophilic side chains"
            >Polar</span
          >
          amino acids have side chains that can form hydrogen bonds with water,
          making them hydrophilic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span
            data-quiz="charged"
            data-hint="Amino acids with charged side chains"
            >Charged</span
          >
          amino acids have side chains that can gain or lose protons, resulting
          in positive or negative charges at physiological pH.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Dive deeper:</strong>

        The primary structure dictates all higher-order structures. Alpha
        helices have a <span data-quiz="right">right</span>-handed twist and are
        stabilized by hydrogen bonds every
        <span data-quiz="4">4</span> residues, while
        <span data-quiz="beta">beta</span> sheets can be parallel or
        antiparallel, with hydrogen bonds between strands. In a tertiary
        structure, <span data-quiz="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</span> interactions
        drive folding, where nonpolar residues cluster inside the protein, away
        from the aqueous environment. The quaternary structure involves multiple
        polypeptide chains, which can be identical or different, forming a
        functional protein complex. <br />

          Conformational stability of proteins is influenced by factors such as
          <span data-quiz="pH">pH</span>
          and temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span data-quiz="denaturation">Denaturation</span> is the loss of
          protein structure and function due to factors like heat, pH changes,
          or chemical agents
        </li>
        <li>
          Hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in protein
          <span data-quiz="folding">folding</span>
          and stability, as nonpolar side chains tend to avoid contact with
          water, driving the folding process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Nonpolar residues cluster in the protein
        core due to the hydrophobic effect, making it the primary driving force
        of protein folding. Since cysteine can form disulfide bonds, a
        <span data-quiz="reducing">reducing</span> agent can break these bonds.
        Since proline introduces kinks, it is often found at the beginning of
        <span data-quiz="alpha">alpha</span> helices or in turns. While
        <span data-quiz="methionine">methionine</span> is sulfur-containing, its
        chemical structure does not allow for the formation of disulfide
        bridges. Changes in <span data-quiz="pH">pH</span> disrupt non-covalent
        interactions like hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds, affecting
        <span data-quiz="secondary">secondary</span>, tertiary, and quaternary
        structures. Primary structure, held by covalent peptide bonds, is
        generally unaffected by denaturation.
