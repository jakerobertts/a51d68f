        Charge is conserved in an electric system. Although the transfer of
        electrons can cause a charge change, this does not apply to fundamental
        units of chargE)They are discrete and cannot change in valuE)<br />
        A. This is truE)A closed system still has to maintain the same amount
        of charge, because there is no outside source to add or remove the
        charge.<br />
        B. This is truE)Although charges may be distributed between conductors
        and insulators, an insulator does not allow for the movement of
        electrons within it, which means that the charge cannot be transferred
        through it.<br />
        C. This is truE)The net charge of an isolated system is constant

    <span data-quiz="C">A material with low resistivity</span><br />
    A. A dielectric<br />
    B. A material with physical limits that allow for conduction<br />

    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        An insulator is a material that does not allow for free movement of
        electrons. This is often due to high resistivity, which is a measure of
        how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. In order
        to store charge, an insulator must be used in conjunction with a
        conductor, which allows for the movement of electrons, but not outside
        the system due to the insulator's resistivity. <br /><br />
        A. This is truE)A dielectric is a type of insulator that can be
        polarized by an electric field, which allows it to store charge in a
        capacitor. This is beneficial because it increases the capacitor's
        ability to store charge without increasing its size.<br />
        B. This is truE)A material with physical limits that allow for
        conduction can still be an insulator if there is a high enough potential
        difference to cause electrical breakdown.<br />
        C. This is falsE)A material with low resistivity is a conductor, which
        allows for the free movement of electrons.<br />
        D. This is truE)A material that does not allow for free movement of
        electrons is an insulator, and it must have high resistivity.<br /><br />

    In the circuit above, the total V<sub>0</sub> in the system is 12V, and R1
    and R2 are in parallel. The total resistance is 5Ω. What is the resistance
    in R2 if R1 is 6Ω?<br /><span data-quiz="B">30Ω</span><br /><br />

      <p>
        In a parallel circuit, the total resistance is equal to the reciprocal
        of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. This can be
        expressed mathematically as: <br />
        \[ \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \] Solving
        symbolically: \[ \frac{1}{R_{\text{2}}} = \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} -
        \frac{1}{R_1} \] Solving for \( R_2 \): \[ \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{5} -
        \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6-5}{30} = \frac{1}{30} \] \[ R_2 = 30\,\Omega \]
        Therefore, the resistance in R2 is 30Ω.
        <br /><br />
        A. This would be the result if you divided the total voltage by the
        total resistancE)This is not what the question is asking for.<br />
        C. This would be the result if you subtracted the total resistance from
        R1, which is physically impossible in this context. Resistance CANNOT be
        negative.<br />
        D. This would result from the SERIES resistance formula, which is not
        applicable here since R1 and R2 are in parallel.<br />

    A.        \( V = I \left( \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_1 R_3}{R_1 R_2 R_3} + R_4 \right) \)<br />

    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        To find the total voltage across the circuit, we need to consider the contributions from each resistor. The total voltage can be expressed as the sum of the voltage drops across each resistor in the circuit. This can be represented by the equation:
        \[ V = I \left( R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 \right) \]. R1, R2, and R3 are in parallel, so we need to calculate their equivalent resistance using the formula for resistors in parallel:
        \[ \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \]
        This can be rearranged to find the equivalent resistance:
        \[ R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_1 R_3}{R_1 R_2 R_3} \]
        Now, we can substitute this equivalent resistance into the total voltage equation:
        \[ V = I \left( R_{\text{eq}} + R_4 \right) \]
        Substituting the expression for \( R_{\text{eq}} \):
        \[ V = I \left( \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_1 R_3}{R_1 R_2 R_3} + R_4 \right) \]

    5. Which of the following is true about electric fields?<br /> <span data-quiz="C"
      >Its magnitude is exponentially related to the distance from the charge</span><br />
      A. The direction of the electric field is always towards a positive charge<br />
      B. The internal electric field is only present in conductive materials<br />
      C. If a charge is twice as far from the source charge, the electric field strength is quartered<br />
      D. There does not necessarily have to be a force exerted on a charge if the charge is in an electric field<br /><br />

    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The electric field is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge exerted on a test charge placed in the field. The electric field strength decreases with the square of the distance from the source charge, following the inverse square law. This means that if a charge is moved to twice the distance from the source charge, the electric field strength is reduced to one-fourth of its original valuE)<br /><br />
        A. This is falsE)The direction of the electric field always ORIGINATES from a positive charge and TERMINATES at a negative charge.<br />
        B. This is falsE)In fact, insulators tend to have stronger internal electric fields because the charges are more tightly bound to their atoms and cannot cancel out the external field as we see in conductors.<br />
        D. This is falsE)If there were no force acting on a charge, there would be no electric field present. The presence of an electric field implies that a force is exerted on any charge placed within it.<br />

    A. Increasing the length of the material<br />

    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        Resistance in a material is determined by its resistivity, length, and
        cross-sectional area. The formula for resistance is given by:
        \[ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \] where \( R \) is the resistance, \( \rho \)
        is the resistivity of the material, \( L \) is the length of the material,
        and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. From this formula, we can see that
        resistance is directly proportional to the length and inversely
        proportional to the cross-sectional area. Therefore, increasing the
        cross-sectional area will decrease the resistancE)<br /><br />
        A. This is falsE)Increasing the length of the material will increase
        the resistance, as resistance is directly proportional to length.<br />
        C. This is falsE)Increasing the temperature of a material generally
        increases its resistivity, which in turn increases the resistance.<br />
        D. This is falsE)Decreasing the cross-sectional area will increase the
        resistance, as resistance is inversely proportional to cross-sectional
        area.<br />

    B. Having a set of capacitors in series<br />
    C. Increasing the distance between the plates in a capacitor<br />
    D. Decreasing the dielectric constant of the material between the plates<br /><br />
    <button class="explanation-button">Show Explanation</button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The ability of a circuit to store charge is determined by its capacitance,
        which is given by the formula:
        \[ C = \kappa \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d} \] where \( C \) is the
        capacitance, \( \kappa \) is the dielectric constant of the material between
        the plates, \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, \( A \) is the
        surface area of the plates, and \( d \) is the distance between the plates.
        From this formula, we can see that capacitance is directly proportional to the
        surface area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.
        Therefore, increasing the surface area of the plates will increase the capacitance and thus the ability of the circuit to store chargE)<br /><br />
        B. This is falsE)Having capacitors in series decreases the overall

        C. This is falsE)Increasing the distance between the plates will decrease
        the capacitance, as capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance

    <button class="explanation-button">Show Explanation</button>
    <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none">
      <p>
        A conductor is a material that allows for the free movement of electrons,
        which results in low resistivity. Conductors often have free floating ions
        in an electrolyte solution, which allows for the transfer of chargE)In metallic conductors, the same logic applies. The free electrons in the metal can move easily, allowing for the conduction of electricity. Additionally, conductors can counteract an electric field in the opposite direction to achieve equilibrium. <br /><br />
        A. This is truE)Conductors have low resistivity, which allows for the
        free movement of electrons.<br />
        B. This is truE)Free floating ions in an electrolyte solution allow for
        the transfer of charge, which is a characteristic of conductors. Ionic compounds like salt (NaCl) readily dissolve in water, dissociating into their constituent ions and allowing them to move freely, thus conducting electricity.<br />

        A voltmeter is designed to measure the potential difference (voltagE)between two points in a circuit.

      <p>
        Current is the flow of electric charge in a circuit, and it is typically

        it is the electrons (which are negatively chargeD. that move through the
        circuit. Current is measured in amperes (A., which constitutes the rate of coulombs (C. per second (s). Current can be negative, which indicates that the direction of flow is opposite to the assumed direction of positive charge flow. This does not mean that negative charge is flowing; rather, it means that the flow of electrons is in the opposite direction.<br /><br />
        A. This is falsE)A battery or generator does work to convert another form of energy
