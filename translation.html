    <h1>Translation</h1>
    <li>
      Initiation: ribosome assembles around the
      <span data-quiz="mRNA">mRNA</span> to be translated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Elongation: tRNA molecules bring
      <span data-quiz="amino acids" data-hint="Building blocks of proteins"
        >amino acids</span
      >
      to the ribosome, where they are added to the growing polypeptide chain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Termination: The ribosome reaches a stop codon, and the completed
      polypeptide is released.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ribosome reads the mRNA in sets of three nucleotides called
      <span data-quiz="codons">codons</span>, each coding for a specific amino
      aci<strong>D.</strong>   The process involves:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The ribosome has three sites: <span data-quiz="A">A</span> (aminoacyl),
        <span data-quiz="P">P</span> (peptidyl), and
        <span data-quiz="E">E</span> (exit).
      </li>
      <li>
        tRNA molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome, matching
        their anticodon with the mRNA codon.
      </li>
      <li>
        rRNA in the ribosome catalyzes the formation of
        <span data-quiz="peptide bonds">peptide bonds</span> between adjacent
        amino acids, elongating the polypeptide chain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peptide bonds form between adjacent amino acids, elongating the
        polypeptide chain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where
      ribosomes read the <span data-quiz="mRNA"></span>mRNA</span> sequence and synthesize proteins. The process is
      initiated by the small ribosomal subunit binding to the <span data-quiz="mRNA">mRNA</span>, followed by
      the large subunit joining to form a complete ribosome.The ribosome moves
      along the mRNA, reading codons and facilitating tRNA binding to ensure
      accurate translation of the genetic code into functional proteins.
      Translation elongation begins at the <span data-quiz="A">A</span> site, where a new tRNA molecule
      carrying an amino acid binds to the codon. The ribosome then shifts to the
      <span data-quiz="P">P</span> site, where the growing polypeptide chain is held, and finally moves to
      the <span data-quiz="E">E</span> site, where the empty tRNA exits. This cycle continues until a stop
      codon is reached, signaling termination of translation at the <span data-quiz="A">A</span> site.
