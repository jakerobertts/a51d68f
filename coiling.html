    <h1>Coiling, Packing, Telomeres & Centromeres</h1>
    <li>
      DNA is organized into a compact structure through coiling and packing,
      which is essential for fitting long DNA molecules into the cell nucleus.
      The key components include:
    </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="nucleosomes">Nucleosomes</span>, which are fundamental
        units of DNA packaging, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone
        proteins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="chromatin">Chromatin</span>, which is the complex of
        DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes during cell division.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="telomeres">Telomeres</span>, which are repetitive
        nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes that protect them from
        degradation and prevent fusion with other chromosomes.
        <span data-quiz="telomerase">Telomerase</span> is an enzyme that extends
        telomeres, allowing cells to divide without losing important genetic
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="centromeres">Centromeres</span>, which are specialized
        regions of chromosomes that play a crucial role in chromosome
        segregation during cell division by serving as attachment points for
        <span data-quiz="spindle fibers">spindle fibers</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="heterochromatin">Heterochromatin</span> is tightly
        packed and transcriptionally inactive, while
        <span data-quiz="euchromatin">euchromatin</span> is loosely packed and
        transcriptionally active.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supercoiling is the twisting of DNA strands around each other, which can
        be either <span data-quiz="positive supercoiling">(overwounD.</span> or
        <span data-quiz="negative supercoiling">(underwounD.</span>. It is
        important for DNA stability and regulation of gene expression.
        <span data-quiz="topoisomerases">Topoisomerases</span> are enzymes that
        manage DNA supercoiling by cutting and rejoining DNA strands to relieve
        torsional strain during DNA replication and transcription.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>In addition to protecting chromosomes from
      degradation, telomeres prevent fusion with other
      <span data-quiz="chromosomes">chromosomes</span> and maintain genomic
      stability. They achieve this by forming a protective cap at the ends of
      chromosomes, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during
      cell division. DNA <span data-quiz="gyrase">gyrase</span> is a type II
      topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils into DNA, helping to
      relieve torsional strain during replication.
      <span data-quiz="TopoIV">TopoIV</span> in bacteria is another important
      topoisomerase that helps to resolve DNA tangles and knots that can form
      during replication.
