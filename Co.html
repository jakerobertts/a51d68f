        are typically inorganic ions such as magnesium (Mg²⁺), iron (Fe²⁺), or
        zinc (Zn²⁺). They bind to the enzyme and are essential for its activity. <br>

        >
        are organic molecules, often derived from vitamins, that assist in
        enzyme function. They can be tightly or loosely bound to the enzyme and
        are often involved in transferring chemical groups during reactions.

        Water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins (e.g., B1, B2, B3, B6, B12) and
        vitamin C often serve as coenzymes. They participate in various
        enzymatic reactions, aiding in processes such as energy production and
        the synthesis of

        are the complete, active forms of enzymes that include their apoenzymes
        and any necessary cofactors or coenzymes. <br> <img src="holoenzyme.png" alt="Holoenzymes" />

      ><span data-quiz="prosthetic groups">Prosthetic groups</span> are
      non-polypeptide units that are tightly and permanently attached to
      enzymes, often playing a crucial role in their function. Coenzymes, on the
      other hand, are loosely bound and can be easily removed.
