            <h2>Passage 1 (Questions 1‑5)</h2>
            <p>
              Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins and
              contain both amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups.
              These organic compounds exist as zwitterions at physiological pH,
              with the amino group protonated and the carboxyl group
              deprotonated. The twenty standard amino acids differ in their side
              chains (R-groups), which determine their chemical properties and
              biological functions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Peptide bonds form through condensation reactions between the
              carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another,
              creating an amide linkage with partial double-bond character due
              to resonance. This restricts rotation around the C-N bond and
              gives proteins their structural stability. All naturally occurring
              amino acids in proteins (except glycine) have the L-configuration.
            </p>

            <p>
              The isoelectric point (pI) of an amino acid is the pH at which it
              carries no net charge. At pH values below the pI, amino acids
              carry a net positive charge, while at pH values above the pI, they
              carry a net negative charge. This property is crucial for protein
              purification and analysis techniques.

            <p>
              Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins and
              contain both amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups.
              These organic compounds exist as zwitterions at physiological pH,
              with the amino group protonated and the carboxyl group
              deprotonated. The twenty standard amino acids differ in their side
              chains (R-groups), which determine their chemical properties and
              biological functions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Peptide bonds form through condensation reactions between the
              carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another,
              creating an amide linkage with partial double-bond character due
              to resonance. This restricts rotation around the C-N bond and
              gives proteins their structural stability. All naturally occurring
              amino acids in proteins (except glycine) have the L-configuration.

              Amino acid synthesis is crucial for understanding biochemical
              pathways and pharmaceutical development. The Strecker synthesis
              and Gabriel synthesis are two important methods for preparing
              amino acids in the laboratory. Both reactions typically yield
              racemic mixtures of D- and L-amino acids, requiring additional
              steps for enantiomeric resolution if pure stereoisomers are
              needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Strecker synthesis begins with an aldehyde, which reacts with
              ammonia or an amine to form an imine intermediate. This imine then
              undergoes nucleophilic addition with hydrogen cyanide to form an
              α-amino nitrile, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield the
              amino acid. The Gabriel synthesis utilizes potassium phthalimide,

              process.

              pathways and pharmaceutical development. The Strecker synthesis
              and Gabriel synthesis are two important methods for preparing
              amino acids in the laboratory. Both reactions typically yield
              racemic mixtures of D- and L-amino acids, requiring additional
              steps for enantiomeric resolution if pure stereoisomers are
              needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Strecker synthesis begins with an aldehyde, which reacts with
              ammonia or an amine to form an imine intermediate. This imine then
              undergoes nucleophilic addition with hydrogen cyanide to form an
              α-amino nitrile, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield the
              amino acid. The Gabriel synthesis utilizes potassium phthalimide,
              diethyl bromomalonate, and an alkyl halide in a multi-step
              process.

            <p>
              Aliphatic amino acids are characterized by hydrocarbon side chains
              containing carbon and hydrogen atoms joined in straight chains,
              branched chains, or non-aromatic rings. These amino acids contrast
              with aromatic amino acids, which contain benzene rings or other
              aromatic systems in their side chains.

            <p>
              Phosphorus-containing compounds play essential roles in biological
              systems and organic chemistry. Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a
              triprotic acid with three ionizable hydrogens, each having
              distinct pKa values (pKa₁ = 2.1, pKa₂ = 7.2, pKa₃ = 12.3). This
              makes phosphoric acid an excellent biological buffer system,
              particularly around physiological pH.
            </p>

            <p>
              At physiological pH (~7.4), phosphoric acid exists primarily as a
              mixture of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, which can act as both proton
              donors and acceptors. The term "inorganic phosphate" (Pi) refers
              to these phosphate species. Organic phosphates, such as ATP and
              GTP, contain phosphate groups covalently bonded to organic
              molecules and serve as energy storage compounds.
            </p>

            <p>
              The backbone of DNA consists of sugar molecules connected by
              phosphodiester bonds, which link the 3'-hydroxyl group of one
              sugar to the 5'-phosphate group of the next. These bonds are
              crucial for the structural integrity of nucleic acids and are
              formed through condensation reactions that eliminate water
              molecules.
