    <h1>Functional Groups</h1>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms that give organic molecules their characteristic chemical properties and reactivity patterns.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="aldehydes" data-hint="R-CHO group">Aldehydes</span> contain a carbonyl group bonded to at least one hydrogen atom, with the general structure R-CHO.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="ketones" data-hint="R-CO-R group">Ketones</span> contain a carbonyl group bonded to two carbon atoms, with the general structure R-CO-R.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="alcohols" data-hint="R-OH group">Alcohols</span> contain a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom, making them polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="carboxylic acids" data-hint="R-COOH group">Carboxylic acids</span> contain a carboxyl group (-COOH) that can donate protons, making them acidic compounds.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="esters" data-hint="R-COO-R group">Esters</span> are formed from the reaction between carboxylic acids and alcohols, with the general structure R-COO-R.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="amides" data-hint="R-CONH₂ group">Amides</span> contain a carbonyl group bonded to a nitrogen atom, commonly found in proteins and synthetic polymers.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="phenols" data-hint="Aromatic alcohols">Phenols</span> are aromatic alcohols with a hydroxyl group directly attached to a benzene ring, making them more acidic than regular alcohols.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="aromatic" data-hint="Benzene-like ring systems">Aromatic</span> compounds contain benzene rings or similar cyclic, planar structures with delocalized electrons.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="heterocyclic" data-hint="Rings containing non-carbon atoms">Heterocyclic</span> compounds are ring structures that contain atoms other than carbon, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="oxidation" data-hint="Loss of electrons or gain of oxygen">Oxidation</span> reactions involve the loss of electrons, often converting alcohols to aldehydes/ketones or aldehydes to carboxylic acids.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="reduction" data-hint="Gain of electrons or loss of oxygen">Reduction</span> reactions involve the gain of electrons, often converting carbonyl groups to alcohols using reducing agents.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="substitution" data-hint="One group replaces another">Substitution</span> reactions involve the replacement of one functional group or atom with another in organic molecules.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="addition" data-hint="Groups added across double bonds">Addition</span> reactions involve the addition of atoms or groups across carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="elimination" data-hint="Groups removed to form double bonds">Elimination</span> reactions involve the removal of groups from adjacent carbons to form carbon-carbon double bonds.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="aldol condensation" data-hint="Aldehyde + ketone reaction">Aldol condensation</span> is a reaction between aldehydes and ketones that forms carbon-carbon bonds, important in biosynthesis.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="esterification" data-hint="Acid + alcohol → ester">Esterification</span> is the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol to form an ester and water.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="hydrolysis" data-hint="Breaking bonds with water">Hydrolysis</span> reactions use water to break chemical bonds, such as converting esters back to acids and alcohols.</li>
    </ul>
