            <p>
              Carbonyl compounds are organic molecules containing a
              carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) and represent one of the most
              important functional groups in organic chemistry. The two primary
              types of simple carbonyl compounds are aldehydes and ketones,
              which differ in their structural arrangements and chemical
              properties.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aldehydes contain a carbonyl group bonded to at least one hydrogen
              atom, making them terminal functional groups. The carbonyl carbon
              in aldehydes is sp² hybridized and exhibits partial positive
              character due to the electronegativity difference between carbon
              and oxygen. This electrophilic nature makes the carbonyl carbon
              susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ketones have their carbonyl carbon bonded to two other carbon
              atoms, placing the carbonyl group within the carbon skeleton
              rather than at a terminus. Both aldehydes and ketones can exist in
              equilibrium with their enol forms through keto-enol
              tautomerization, though the keto form typically predominates due
              to the higher stability of the C=O double bond compared to the C=C
              double bond.

              The synthesis and reduction of carbonyl compounds involves
              selective oxidation and reduction reactions that must be carefully
              controlled to achieve the desired products. Primary alcohols can
              be oxidized to aldehydes or further to carboxylic acids, while
              secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones. The choice of
              oxidizing agent determines the extent of oxidation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weak oxidizing agents such as pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)
              allow for the controlled oxidation of primary alcohols to
              aldehydes without further oxidation to carboxylic acids. Strong
              oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) and chromic
              acid (H₂Cr₂O₄) will completely oxidize primary alcohols to
              carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reduction reactions of carbonyl compounds require careful
              selection of reducing agents based on the desired outcome. Sodium
              borohydride (NaBH₄) is a mild reducing agent capable of reducing
              aldehydes and ketones to alcohols but cannot reduce carboxylic
              acids or esters. For the reduction of carboxylic acids and esters
              to alcohols, stronger reducing agents such as lithium aluminum
              hydride (LiAlH₄) are required.

              The synthesis and reduction of carbonyl compounds involves
              selective oxidation and reduction reactions that must be carefully

              The α-carbon in carbonyl compounds plays a crucial role in many
              important organic reactions. This carbon atom, adjacent to the
              carbonyl group, bears hydrogen atoms that are significantly more
              acidic than typical alkyl hydrogens due to the
              electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. Removal of an
              α-hydrogen results in the formation of an enolate anion, a key
              intermediate in many synthetic transformations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Enolate formation can occur under kinetic or thermodynamic
              control, leading to different regioisomers when multiple α-carbons
              are present. Kinetic enolates form rapidly and typically involve
              deprotonation of the less hindered α-carbon, while thermodynamic
              enolates form under equilibrating conditions and favor the more
              substituted, more stable enolate.
