    <h1>Optics</h1>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and optical instruments.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="reflection" data-hint="Light bouncing off surfaces">Reflection</span> occurs when light bounces off a surface, following the law that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="refraction" data-hint="Light bending when changing media">Refraction</span> is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Snell's law" data-hint="n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂)">Snell's law</span> mathematically describes refraction, relating the angles and refractive indices of two media.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="dispersion" data-hint="Separation of white light into colors">Dispersion</span> is the separation of white light into its component colors due to wavelength-dependent refraction.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="total internal reflection" data-hint="Complete reflection at interface">Total internal reflection</span> occurs when light traveling from a denser to a less dense medium is completely reflected at the interface.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="spherical mirrors" data-hint="Curved mirrors with spherical surfaces">Spherical mirrors</span> are curved mirrors with surfaces that form part of a sphere, including both concave and convex mirrors.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="focal length" data-hint="Distance from mirror/lens to focal point">Focal length</span> is the distance from a lens or mirror to the point where parallel rays converge or appear to diverge.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="thin lenses" data-hint="1/p + 1/q = 1/f">Thin lenses</span> are optical elements that refract light, with their behavior described by the thin lens equation relating object distance, image distance, and focal length.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="diopters" data-hint="Lens power units">Diopters</span> are the units used to measure the optical power of lenses, equal to the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.</li>
      
      
    </ul>
