    <ul>
      <li>Atomic structure describes the arrangement of protons, neutrons, and electrons within atoms and how this determines their chemical properties.</li>
      
      <li>Atomic <span data-quiz="orbitals" data-hint="Regions where electrons are likely found">orbitals</span> are three-dimensional regions around the nucleus where electrons are most likely to be found.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="quantum states" data-hint="Energy levels and electron configurations">Quantum states</span> describe the energy levels and spatial distributions of electrons in atoms using quantum numbers.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="Pauli principle" data-hint="No two electrons same quantum state">Pauli principle</span> states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="electronic notation" data-hint="Method of writing electron configurations">Electronic notation</span> is the systematic way of representing the electron configuration of atoms using orbital designations.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="Bohr model" data-hint="Planetary model of the atom">Bohr model</span> describes the atom as a nucleus with electrons orbiting in fixed energy levels or shells.</li>
      
      <li>Heisenberg's <span data-quiz="uncertainty principle" data-hint="Cannot know position and momentum exactly">uncertainty principle</span> states that you cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of an electron.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="effective nuclear charge" data-hint="Net positive charge felt by electron">Effective nuclear charge</span> is the net positive charge experienced by an electron after accounting for shielding by other electrons.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="photoelectric effect" data-hint="Light ejects electrons">photoelectric effect</span> demonstrates the particle nature of light, where photons can eject electrons from metal surfaces.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="alkali metals" data-hint="Group 1 elements">Alkali metals</span> are highly reactive Group 1 elements with one valence electron that they readily lose to form +1 cations.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="alkaline earth" data-hint="Group 2 elements">Alkaline earth</span> metals are Group 2 elements with two valence electrons that form +2 cations.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="halogens" data-hint="Group 17 elements">Halogens</span> are highly reactive Group 17 elements with seven valence electrons that readily gain one electron to form -1 anions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="noble gases" data-hint="Group 18 elements">Noble gases</span> are Group 18 elements with complete valence shells, making them chemically inert under normal conditions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="transition metals" data-hint="d-block elements">Transition metals</span> are d-block elements that can form multiple oxidation states due to their partially filled d orbitals.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="ionization energy" data-hint="Energy to remove electron">Ionization energy</span> is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="electron affinity" data-hint="Energy change when electron added">Electron affinity</span> is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a gaseous atom.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="electronegativity" data-hint="Attraction for electrons">Electronegativity</span> is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="atomic size" data-hint="Size of neutral atoms">Atomic size</span> refers to the size of neutral atoms, which generally decreases across periods and increases down groups.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="ionic size" data-hint="Size of charged ions">Ionic size</span> refers to the size of ions, with cations being smaller and anions being larger than their neutral atoms.</li>
    </ul>
