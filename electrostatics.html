    <h1>Electrostatics</h1>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Electrostatics is the study of electric charges at rest and the forces, fields, and potentials associated with stationary charges.</li>
      
      <li>Electric <span data-quiz="charge" data-hint="Fundamental property of matter">charge</span> is a fundamental property of matter that comes in positive and negative forms and is conserved in all interactions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="conductors" data-hint="Materials that allow charge flow">Conductors</span> are materials like metals that allow electric charges to move freely through them.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="insulators" data-hint="Materials that resist charge flow">Insulators</span> are materials like rubber and glass that resist the flow of electric charge.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="charge conservation" data-hint="Total charge remains constant">Charge conservation</span> states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant over time.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Coulomb's law" data-hint="Force between point charges">Coulomb's law</span> describes the electrostatic force between two point charges as proportional to their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.</li>
      
      <li>An <span data-quiz="electric field" data-hint="Force per unit charge">electric field</span> represents the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a small test charge placed in the field.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="field lines" data-hint="Visual representation of electric fields">Field lines</span> provide a visual representation of electric fields, pointing from positive to negative charges.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="electrostatic energy" data-hint="Potential energy of charge distributions">Electrostatic energy</span> is the potential energy stored in configurations of electric charges.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="electric potential" data-hint="Electric potential energy per unit charge">Electric potential</span> is the electric potential energy per unit charge at a point in an electric field.</li>
      
      <li>Electric <span data-quiz="current" data-hint="I = ΔQ/Δt">current</span> is the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor, measured in amperes.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="electromotive force" data-hint="EMF drives current flow">Electromotive force</span> (EMF) is the energy per unit charge supplied by a source like a battery to drive current through a circuit.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="voltage" data-hint="Potential difference between points">Voltage</span> is the potential difference between two points, representing the work done per unit charge in moving charge between those points.</li>
      
      <li>Electrical <span data-quiz="resistance" data-hint="Opposition to current flow">resistance</span> is the opposition to the flow of electric current through a material or device.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Ohm's law" data-hint="V = IR">Ohm's law</span> states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="resistivity" data-hint="ρ = R·A/L">Resistivity</span> is an intrinsic property of materials that quantifies how strongly they oppose the flow of electric current.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="capacitance" data-hint="Ability to store charge">Capacitance</span> is the ability of a system to store electric charge, measured as charge stored per unit voltage.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="dielectrics" data-hint="Insulating materials in capacitors">Dielectrics</span> are insulating materials placed between capacitor plates that increase the capacitance by reducing the electric field.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="conductivity" data-hint="Reciprocal of resistivity">Conductivity</span> is the reciprocal of resistivity, measuring how easily electric current can flow through a material.</li>
