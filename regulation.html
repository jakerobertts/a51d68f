        data-hint="Regulation type involving non-active site binding"
        >Allosteric</span
      >
      regulation involves the binding of a molecule to a site other than the
      active site, causing a conformational change that affects enzyme activity.
      This type of regulation can either enhance or inhibit enzyme activity,
      depending on the nature of the effector molecule.

        data-hint="Enzyme activity change via chemical group addition/removal"
        >Covalent modification</span
      >
      involves the addition or removal of a chemical group (e.g., phosphate)
      to/from the enzyme, leading to changes in activity.

        data-hint="Regulatory mechanism by end product"
        >Feedback inhibition</span
      >
      is a regulatory mechanism in which the end product of a metabolic pathway
      inhibits an upstream process, preventing the overproduction of the
      product.

      <span data-quiz="zymogen" data-hint="Inactive enzyme precursor"
        >zymogen</span
      >
      is an inactive precursor of an enzyme that requires a biochemical change
      (e.g., cleavage) to become active.
