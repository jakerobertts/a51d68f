        data-quiz="Allosteric"
        data-hint="Regulation type involving non-active site binding"
        >Allosteric</span
      >
      regulation involves the binding of a molecule to a site other than the
      active site, causing a conformational change that affects enzyme activity.
      This type of regulation can either enhance or inhibit enzyme activity,
      depending on the nature of the effector molecule.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="Covalent modification"
        data-hint="Enzyme activity change via chemical group addition/removal"
        >Covalent modification</span
      >
      involves the addition or removal of a chemical group (e.g., phosphate)
      to/from the enzyme, leading to changes in activity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        data-quiz="Feedback inhibition"
        data-hint="Regulatory mechanism by end product"
        >Feedback inhibition</span
      >
      is a regulatory mechanism in which the end product of a metabolic pathway
      inhibits an upstream process, preventing the overproduction of the
      product.
    </li>
    <li>
      A
      <span data-quiz="zymogen" data-hint="Inactive enzyme precursor"
        >zymogen</span
      >
      is an inactive precursor of an enzyme that requires a biochemical change
      (e.g., cleavage) to become active.

    <p>
      <strong>Dive deeper: </strong>Phosphofructokinase is inhibited by
      <span data-quiz="ATP">ATP</span> allosterically. Phosphorylation by
      kinases is an example of
      <span data-quiz="covalent modification">covalent modification</span>
      modification. This can activate or inhibit enzymes in common hormone
      signaling pathways. Trypsinogen is a zymogen that is converted into
      <span data-quiz="trypsin">trypsin</span>, which helps digest proteins in
      the small intestine.
