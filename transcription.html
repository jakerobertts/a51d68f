    <h1>Transcription</h1>
    <li>
      Transcription is the process of synthesizing
      <span data-quiz="RNA">RNA</span> from a DNA template. It occurs in the
      nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The
      main steps include:
    </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Initiation">Initiation</span>: RNA polymerase binds to
        the
        <span
          data-quiz="promoter"
          data-hint="Region of DNA where transcription begins"
          >promoter</span
        >
        region of the gene, unwinding the DNA double helix.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Elongation">Elongation</span>: RNA polymerase
        synthesizes a single-stranded RNA molecule by adding ribonucleotides
        complementary to the DNA template strand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Termination">Termination</span>: RNA polymerase reaches
        a termination signal, causing it to detach from the DNA and release the
        newly synthesized RNA molecule.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Transcription occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning RNA nucleotides
      are added to the 3' end of the growing RNA strand.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transcription occurs in the
      <span
        data-quiz="nucleus"
        data-hint="Membrane-bound organelle containing DNA"
        >nucleus</span
      >
      of eukaryotic cells, where the DNA is located, and in the
      <span
        data-quiz="cytoplasm"
        data-hint="Region of the cell outside the nucleus"
        >cytoplasm</span
      >
      of prokaryotic cells, where DNA is not compartmentalized.
