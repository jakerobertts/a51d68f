    <h1>Alleles & Genes</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A
        <span data-quiz="gene">gene</span>
        is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or functional RNA.
      </li>
      <li>
        An
        <span data-quiz="allele">allele</span>
        is a variant form of a gene that can result in different traits or
        phenotypes.
      </li>
      <li>
        For every gene in each human, there are
        <span data-quiz="two">two</span> alleles, leading to genetic variation
        within a population.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alleles can be dominant or recessive. A
        <span data-quiz="dominant">dominant</span>
        allele masks the effect of a recessive allele when both are present in
        an individual.
      </li>
      <li>
        An individual with two identical alleles for a trait is said to be
        <span data-quiz="homozygous">homozygous</span>, while an individual with
        two different alleles is
        <span data-quiz="heterozygous">heterozygous</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <span data-quiz="genotype">genotype</span> is the genetic makeup of an
        individual, while a <span data-quiz="phenotype">phenotype</span> is the
        observable expression of that genotype.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span data-quiz="wild-type">wild-type</span> allele is the most
        common form of a gene in a population, while mutant alleles are less
        common and can arise from mutations.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <span data-quiz="locus">locus</span> is the specific location of a
        gene on a chromosome, and alleles at a locus can vary in sequence,
        leading to different traits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alleles can undergo
        <span
          data-quiz="incomplete dominance"
          data-hint="The phenotype is a blend of both alleles."
          >incomplete dominance</span
        >
        or
        <span
          data-quiz="codominance"
          data-hint="Both alleles are fully expressed."
          >codominance</span
        >, where both alleles contribute to the phenotype in different ways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Leakage">Leakage</span> is the transfer of alleles
        between species, which can occur through hybridization or horizontal
        gene transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Penetrance">Penetrance</span> refers to the proportion
        of individuals with a specific genotype that express the expected
        phenotype, while
        <span data-quiz="Expressivity">expressivity</span> refers to the degree
        to which a genotype is expressed in an individual.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Genetic Drift">Genetic Drift</span> is the change in
        allele frequencies in a population due to random sampling events, which
        can lead to the loss of genetic variation over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Founder Effect">Founder Effect</span> occurs when a
        small group of individuals establishes a new population, leading to
        reduced genetic variation compared to the original population.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Gene pool">Gene pool</span> refers to the total
        collection of alleles in a population, which can change over time due to
        factors like natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift.
      </li>
    </ul>
