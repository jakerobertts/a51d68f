    <h1>Acids and Bases</h1>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acids and bases are fundamental chemical concepts that describe proton transfer reactions and solution chemistry in aqueous systems.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="Brønsted-Lowry" data-hint="Proton donor/acceptor definition">Brønsted-Lowry</span> definition describes acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors in chemical reactions.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="pH" data-hint="-log[H⁺]">pH</span> is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, providing a scale from 0-14 to measure acidity and basicity.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Ka" data-hint="Acid dissociation constant">Ka</span> is the acid dissociation constant that quantifies the strength of an acid by measuring its degree of ionization.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="Kb" data-hint="Base dissociation constant">Kb</span> is the base dissociation constant that quantifies the strength of a base by measuring its degree of ionization.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="pKa" data-hint="Negative log of Ka">pKa</span> is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, with lower pKa values indicating stronger acids.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="pKb" data-hint="Negative log of Kb">pKb</span> is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant, with lower pKb values indicating stronger bases.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="buffers" data-hint="Resist pH changes">Buffers</span> are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, consisting of weak acid-conjugate base pairs.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="titration" data-hint="Gradual addition to determine concentration">Titration</span> is an analytical technique where a solution of known concentration is gradually added to determine the concentration of another solution.</li>
      
      <li>The <span data-quiz="equivalence point" data-hint="Moles acid = moles base">equivalence point</span> in a titration is reached when the moles of acid equal the moles of base added.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="indicators" data-hint="Color change at specific pH">Indicators</span> are compounds that change color at specific pH ranges, used to detect the endpoint of titrations.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="neutralization" data-hint="Acid + base → salt + water">Neutralization</span> reactions occur when acids and bases react to form salt and water, with the pH moving toward 7.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="strong acid" data-hint="Complete ionization in water">Strong acid</span> completely ionizes in aqueous solution, releasing all available protons and having very low pKa values.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="weak acid" data-hint="Partial ionization in water">Weak acid</span> only partially ionizes in aqueous solution, establishing an equilibrium between ionized and unionized forms.</li>
      
      <li><span data-quiz="conjugate pairs" data-hint="Acid-base pairs differing by H⁺">Conjugate pairs</span> are acid-base pairs that differ by a single proton, related through proton transfer reactions.</li>
    </ul>
