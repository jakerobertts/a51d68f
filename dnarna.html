    <h1>DNA Denaturation</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        DNA denaturation is the process of separating the two strands of the
        <span data-quiz="double helix">double helix</span>, typically induced by heat or chemical treatment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Reannealing">Reannealing</span> occurs when the denatured strands come back together,
        forming a stable double helix again. <br> <img src="reannealing.png" alt="Reannealing process">
      </li>
      <li>
        <span data-quiz="Hybridization">Hybridization</span> refers to the binding of complementary DNA or RNA strands
        from different sources, often used in techniques like blotting and
        microarray analysis. <br> <img src="hybridzation.png" alt="Hybridization process">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Dive deeper: </strong>The <span data-quiz="melting temperature">melting temperature</span> is the temperature at which half of the DNA strands become single-strande<strong>D.</strong>   Although the number of hydrogen bonds between the base pairs contributes to the stability of the double helix, other factors such as the length of the DNA and the concentration of <span data-quiz="salt">salt</span> in the solution also play important roles in determining the melting temperature.The salt concentration affects the shielding of negative charges on the DNA <span data-quiz="backbone">backbone</span>, influencing the stability of the double helix. When the temperature is normal, denaturation requires energy input to overcome the hydrogen bonding and base stacking interactions that stabilize the double helix.</p>
