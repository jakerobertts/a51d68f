    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
      The MCAT is a standardized exam to get into medical school. It is used to
      assess the knowledge and skills of prospective medical students. This site
      provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts and topics relevant to
      the MCAT, including biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, and
      sociology. There are four main skills needed for the MCAT: content
      knowledge, problem-solving, data analysis, and critical thinking. The site
      is designed to help students prepare for the exam by providing clear
      explanations, interactive quizzes, and practice questions. The MCAT is
      extremely extensive. This site provides a condensed guide to Skills 1 and
      2 (content knowledge and problem-solving) to help students focus on the
      most important concepts. Thus, data analysis and critical thinking are
      limited on this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site is organized into sections based on the MCAT content categories,
      with each section containing detailed explanations, diagrams, and
      interactive quizzes to reinforce learning. The goal is to provide a
      comprehensive yet accessible resource for students preparing for the MCAT.
      The B/B section is the most extensive and covers a wide range of topics in
      biology and biochemistry, including cell biology, genetics, molecular
      biology, and physiology. The C/P section covers chemistry and physics
      concepts relevant to the MCAT, including chemical reactions,
      thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Thus, these sections are broken up
      into several subtopic pages. The P/S section focuses on psychology and
      sociology concepts, including social behavior, cognition, and mental
      processes.
